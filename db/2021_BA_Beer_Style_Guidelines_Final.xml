				Compiled by the Brewers Association, copyright: 1993 through and including 2021. With  Style Guideline Committee assistance and review by Chris Swersey, Paul Gatza, Chuck Skypeck, Kaylyn Kirkpatrick, Chris Williams, Andrew Sparhawk and Dan Rabin, and suggestions from Great American Beer Festival® and World Beer Cup&amp;#8480; judges, brewers, beer writers and beer lovers from around the world. <br/><br/>
Since 1979 the Brewers Association has provided beer style descriptions as a reference for brewers and beer competition organizers. Much of the early work was based on the assistance and contributions of beer journalist Michael Jackson; more recently these guidelines were greatly expanded, compiled, and edited by Charlie Papazian. The task of creating a realistic set of guidelines is always complex. The beer style guidelines developed by the Brewers Association use sources from the commercial brewing industry, beer analyses, and consultations with beer industry experts and knowledgeable beer enthusiasts as resources for information. <br/><br/>
The Brewers Association's beer style guidelines reflect, as much as possible, historical significance, authenticity, or a high profile in the current commercial beer market. Often, the historical significance is not clear, or a new beer type in a current market may represent only a passing fad and is quickly forgotten. For these reasons, the addition of a style or the modification of an existing one is not undertaken lightly and is the product of research, consultation, and consideration of market actualities, and may take place over several years. <br/><br/>
Another factor considered is that current commercial examples do not always fit well into the historical record, and instead represent a modern version of the style. Our decision to include a particular historical beer style takes into consideration the style's brewing traditions and the need to preserve those traditions in today's market. The more a beer style has withstood the test of time, marketplace, and consumer acceptance, the more likely it is to be included in the Brewers Association's style guidelines. <br/><br/>
The availability of commercial examples plays a large role in whether a beer style "makes the list." It is important to consider that not every historical or commercial beer style can be included, nor is every commercial beer representative of the historical tradition (i.e., a brewery labeling a brand as a particular style does not always indicate a fair representation of that style). <br/><br/>
Please note that almost all of the classic and traditional beer style guidelines have been cross-referenced with data from commercially available beers representative of the style. The primary reference for this purpose has been Professor Anton Piendl's comprehensive work published in the German Brauindustrie magazine through the years 1982 to 1994, from the series "Biere Aus Aller Welt." <br/><br/>
Each style description is purposefully written independently of any reference to another beer style to the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, as much as it is possible, beer character is not described in terms of ingredients or process. These guidelines attempt to emphasize final evaluation of the product and try not to proscribe the formulation or process by which it was brewed, except in special circumstances whereby processing clearly defines a style or sensory outcomes. Suggestions for adding or updating a beer style guideline may be submitted by following the links on this page: https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers- association-beer-style-guidelines/#tab-submitsuggestions. <br/><br/>
The bitterness specifications (IBUs) given in these guidelines are based on standard measurements for bitterness derived from kettle isomerization of naturally occurring alpha acids. Since reduced isomerized hop extracts may produce substantially different perceived bitterness levels when measured by this technique, brewers who use such extracts should enter competitions based upon the perceived bitterness present in the finished product. It is important to note that perceived bitterness by the beer drinker will not always align with expectations created by IBU specifications. <br/><br/>
Notes on Beer Style Guidelines: It is very difficult to consistently align analytical data with perceived flavor outcomes. It is also very difficult to consistently align written beer descriptions with analytical data and perceived flavor outcomes. <br/><br/>
1. Intensity Level Terminology: Beer flavor attributes referenced in the beer style guidelines are often referenced in terms of relative intensity. These attributes can include bitterness, flavor, aroma, body, malt, sweetness, and hundreds of individual flavor attributes. In order of increasing intensity, the descriptions used include: <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
● None ● Very low ● Low ● Medium-low ● Medium ● Medium-high ● High ● Very high ● Intense <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
2. Color Ranges: The American SRM (Standard Reference Method) and EBC (European <br/><br/>
Brewing Convention) of measuring beer color measure the intensity of a certain wavelength of light. These numerical values do not always coincide with our visual perception of color lightness and darkness or hue. When in doubt the description of color has priority. In order from lightest descriptor to darkest descriptor: <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Color Description <br/><br/>
SRM <br/><br/>
Very light <br/><br/>
1-1.5 <br/><br/>
Straw <br/><br/>
2-3 <br/><br/>
Pale <br/><br/>
4 <br/><br/>
Gold <br/><br/>
5-6 <br/><br/>
Light amber <br/><br/>
7 <br/><br/>
Amber <br/><br/>
8 <br/><br/>
Medium amber <br/><br/>
9 <br/><br/>
Copper/garnet <br/><br/>
10-12 <br/><br/>
Light brown <br/><br/>
13-15 <br/><br/>
Brown/Reddish brown/chestnut brown <br/><br/>
16-17 <br/><br/>
Dark brown <br/><br/>
18-24 <br/><br/>
Very dark <br/><br/>
25-39 <br/><br/>
Black <br/><br/>
40+ <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
3. Bitterness: In the beer world bitterness is analytically measured as “bittering units” or “international bitterness units.” The numerical value is a measure of a specific hop compound and will not consistently coincide with an individual’s perception of bitterness intensity. a. Due to genetics and other differences, individuals will have varying sensitivity to bitterness. Some will sense high intensity bitterness, while others perceive no bitterness in the same beer. The descriptions of bitterness in these guidelines are inclined towards representing average sensitivity to bitterness. b. Other beer ingredients can contribute perception of bitterness to beer. c. The intensity and quality of hop flavor and aroma derived from oils, pellets, whole hops, or other hop formats can greatly alter the perception of bitterness intensity. <br/><br/>

Notes on Beer Competitions: Brewers Association Beer Style Guidelines form the basis for the guidelines at the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and World Beer Cup (WBC). <br/><br/>
1. Competition Categories: GABF and WBC categories may contain one or more beer styles. Categories with multiple beer styles will be organized into subcategories of similar style beers. Often this provides the category with sufficient entries to make the category competitive or meet minimum entry numbers. <br/><br/>
2. Beer Style Guidelines: Categories at competition may differ somewhat from this guideline document. They may include special notes which pertain to that competition. These notes might solicit special information from brewers to be provided to judges so they may evaluate beer entries more accurately or provide clarity to entering brewers regarding possibly confusing or overlapping aspects of beer style categories. 3. Pouring: Beers entered and presented for evaluation in competitions should be poured and presented as intended by the brewer. Most beers are intended to be poured quietly; some beers are intended to be roused in order to present the beer with yeast that may be present in the bottle. If practical, competition organizers should allow brewers the opportunity to provide explicit pouring instructions and present beers to judges in the manner requested by the brewer. <br/><br/>

			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Copper-red to very dark <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Fruity esters can enhance and complement the malt aroma and flavor profile. Old Ales have malt and sometimes caramel sweetness. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Present but minimal <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Fruity esters can contribute to the character of these beers. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of Old Ales is that they undergo an aging process, often for years. Aging can occur on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle. This contributes to a rich, wine-like, and often sweet, oxidized character. Complex estery attributes may also emerge. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels. <br/><br/>

While there are conflicting theories as to whether traditional Scotch Ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many examples with peat smoke character present at low to medium levels. Peat smoke attributes may be absent or present at low to medium levels. Versions exhibiting higher levels of smoke character are categorized as Smoke Beer. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on presence or absence of peat smoke-derived attributes. 			</body>

<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Opaque <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> The prominence of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aroma and flavor defines much of the character. The hallmark dry-roasted attributes typical of Dry Stout result from the use of roasted barley. Initial malt and light caramel flavors give way to a distinctive dry-roasted bitterness in the finish. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> European hop character may range from not present to low in aroma and flavor <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Medium to medium-high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Fruity esters are low relative to malt and roasted barley as well as hop bitterness. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at very low levels. Slight acidity may be present but is not required. <br/><br/>

When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, hop varieties, or underlying beer styles. 			</body>

			<name>Juicy or Hazy Imperial or Double India Pale Ale</name>
			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Straw to light amber <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Low to very high degree of cloudiness is typical of these beers. Starch, yeast, hop, protein and/or other compounds contribute to a wide range of hazy appearance within this category. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to high malt aroma and flavor may be present <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> High to intense, exhibiting a very wide range of attributes, especially fruity, tropical, and juicy. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to medium. The impression of bitterness is soft and well-integrated into overall balance, and may differ significantly from measured or calculated IBU levels. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Medium-high to high fruity esters are present, and can contribute to the perception of sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile. Diacetyl should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Medium to high. A silky or full mouthfeel may contribute to overall flavor profile. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Grist may include oats, wheat, or other adjuncts to promote haziness. The term "juicy" is frequently used to describe taste and aroma hop- derived attributes often present in these beers which result from late, often very large, additions of hops. A juicy character is not required, however. Other hop- derived attributes such as citrus, pine, spice, floral or others may be present with or without the presence of juicy attributes. Versions of this style brewed with darker malts, non-traditional ale yeasts, fruits, spices, or other flavorings are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales. 			</body>

<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Pale to black <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze is acceptable at any temperature. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and flavors should be present at low levels. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> None to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> None to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Moderate to intense, yet balanced, fruity esters are present. Diacetyl, DMS and Brettanomyces should not be present. The evolution of natural acidity at medium-low to high levels develops a balanced complexity and is expressed as a refreshing, pleasant sourness, in harmony with other attributes. The acidity present is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in kettle or post wort fermentation and is produced by various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and attributes of age. There should be no residual flavors from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood- derived flavors such as vanillin should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Beers exhibiting wood-derived characters or characters of liquids previously aged in wood are categorized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Fruited versions are categorized elsewhere. <br/><br/>
Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, hop varieties, microflora, spices, or other ingredients, etc. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Malt character is very low to low with soft sweetness. Caramel character should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low, and if present, should express noble hop character. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Medium to medium-high <br/><br/>

<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to medium-low. Dry and crisp. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Traditional examples often display persistent head retention. Small amounts of wheat can be used in brewing beers of this style. Koelsch- style beers are fermented at warmer temperatures than is typical for lagers, but at lower temperatures than most English and Belgian-style ales. They are aged cold. Ale yeast is used for fermentation. Lager yeast is sometimes used for bottle conditioning or final cold conditioning. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Clear to slightly hazy. Chill haze should not be present <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> A variety of malts contributes to medium-low to medium malt aroma and flavor. Toast aroma typical of Munich malts should be present. Slight nuttiness is acceptable. Roast malt character should be present at low levels and well-integrated with the overall malt profile. Smoke character should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to medium with hop flavor more perceptible than aroma, with attributes typical of traditional German noble hops. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Medium to high, producing a clean dry finish. Forty-plus IBU is typical for Altbiers originating in Dusseldorf. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Fruity esters are absent to low, with attributes expressed subtly as citrus, pear, dark cherry or plum. A slight sulfur aroma is acceptable. Diacetyl should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Medium-low to medium. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Straw to pale. These are the lightest of all the German wheat beers. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> May appear hazy or cloudy from yeast or chill haze <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Malt sweetness is absent <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Not present <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Not present to very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Fruity esters are low to medium. Diacetyl should not be present. Brettanomyces character may be absent or present at low to medium levels, and if present may be expressed as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic aromas and flavors. The unique combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria fermentation yields a beer that is acidic and highly attenuated. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Carbonation is high. Traditionally, some Berliners were brewed or served with fruit, spices, or syrups. Some more contemporary versions have been brewed with other ingredients such as darker malts. Any such versions will take on corresponding hues, and may exhibit flavor and aroma attributes typical of such ingredients. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on the addition of fruit, spice or specialty malt, or other ingredients or processes. Fruited or flavored entries would be accompanied by a very brief description of the fruit/flavor used by the brewer. 			</body>

<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to medium-low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These beers typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some versions also containing oats. Salt (table salt) and coriander may be present in low amounts or may be absent. All Gose brands brewed with fruit(s), spices (other than salt or coriander), darker malts or other ingredients are categorized as Contemporary-Style Gose. Carbonation is high to very high.

			<name>Contemporary-Style Gose</name>
			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Usually straw to medium amber and can take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients such as darker malts. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Clear to hazy. Haze may or may not result from yeast <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Malt aroma and flavor is not present to very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low to low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Not present to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Horsey, leathery, or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be present but at low levels as these beers do not undergo prolonged aging. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Alternatively, they may be spontaneously fermented. Low to medium lactic acid character is present in all examples expressed as a sharp, refreshing sourness. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to medium-low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These beers may be brewed with malted barley, wheat and oats and unmalted barley, wheat, and oats; contemporary examples may also contain other grains. As in traditional examples, low level salt (table salt) and coriander additions may or may not be present in Contemporary Gose. Attributes from the use of a wide variety of herbs, spices, flowers, fruits or other ingredients not found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose may also be present and in harmony with overall flavor profile. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Not present to very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Med-low to med-high fruity and phenolic attributes are hallmarks of this style. Phenolic attributes such as clove, nutmeg, smoke, and vanilla are present. Banana ester aroma and flavor should be present at low to medium-high levels. Diacetyl should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Medium to full <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. Hefeweizens are very highly carbonated. These beers are typically (though not always) roused during pouring, and when yeast is present, they will have a yeasty flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel. 			</body>

			<name>South German-Style Kristal Weizen</name>
			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Straw to amber <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Clear with no chill haze present. Because the beer is filtered, no yeast should be present. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Not present to very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> The aroma and flavor are very similar to Hefeweizen with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-like or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. A Banana-like ester aroma and flavor is often present. Diacetyl should not be present. Kristal Weizens are well attenuated and very highly carbonated. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Medium to full <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat. They have no yeast flavor and they exhibit a cleaner, drier mouthfeel than counterparts served with yeast. 			</body>

<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> The phenolic and estery aromas typical of Weissbiers should be present but less pronounced in this style. The overall flavor profile is less complex than Hefeweizen due to a lower alcohol content and there is less yeasty flavor. Diacetyl should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low with a lighter mouthfeel than Hefeweizen. The German word “leicht” means light, and as such these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> In darker versions, malt aromas and flavors can optionally include low roasted malt characters expressed as cocoa/chocolate or caramel, and/or aromatic toffee, caramel, or biscuit attributes. Malt sweetness can vary from low to medium. Low level of roast malt astringency is acceptable when balanced with low to medium malt sweetness. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Not present <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low to low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Low to medium banana–like and/or other fruity ester aromas and flavors are typical. Clove-like and/or other phenolic aromas and flavors should also be present. No yeast aroma should be present in versions without yeast. Versions packaged and served without yeast will not have yeast flavor or full mouthfeel typical of beers with yeast. Versions with yeast will have low to medium yeast aroma and flavor and a full mouthfeel, but the yeast character should not overpower the balance of rye and barley malts, esters and phenolics. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Grist should include at least 30 percent rye malt. Versions with yeast are often roused during pouring. When yeast is present, the beer should have a yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel. 			</body>

			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Gold to black. Caramel color is sometimes added to adjust color. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Beer color may be too dark to perceive. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Mild malt character may be present <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Not present to very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low to low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Diacetyl should not be present. Traditional versions do not use artificial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions can incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharin added post fermentation for additional sweetness and to increase smoothness. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These beers may contain malted barley, wheat, and rye as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats, and corn. Though not common, flavorings such as coriander or orange and lemon peel are sometimes added, but are barely perceptible. The mouthfeel is light to moderate, and sometimes boosted with unfermented sugars/malt sugars. Low carbonation and aftertaste are typical. 			</body>

<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> May vary widely <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low to low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low to low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low to low but sufficient to balance other attributes <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Phenolic spiciness may be absent or may be present at low levels. Fruity-ester complexity may range from low to medium, in harmony with malt and other attributes. Diacetyl should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Very low to low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Beers in this category recognize the uniqueness and traditions of Belgian brewing, but do not hew to any other classic or "Other" Belgian-style categories defined in these guidelines. The most notable characteristic that these beers share is a modest alcohol content of 2.1% - 5% abv. These beers can be lower gravity formulations of their own, or can be produced from second run wort from the production of higher gravity beers. Balance is a key component when assessing these beers. Wood- and barrel-aged versions which exhibit attributes of wood aging should be categorized as wood- and barrel-aged beers. Fruited versions are categorized as Belgian-style fruit beers. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying Belgian beer style not otherwise defined in these guidelines or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Specialty Saisons represent a very wide family of specialty beers. Entries brewed with dark malts, fruit(s), spice(s), or other special ingredients may deviate substantially from traditional appearance and flavor and from parameters shown in this guideline. Ingredients including spices, herbs, flowers, fruits, vegetables, fermentable sugars and carbohydrates, special yeasts of all types, wood aging, etc. may contribute unique attributes to these beers. Earthy and/or cellar-like aromas are acceptable. Color, body, malt character, esters, alcohol level and hop character should harmonize with attributes from special ingredients. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients such as malts and grains, hop varieties, microflora, fruit, spices, or other ingredients, etc. or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

These versions are said to be "Belgian-Style Lambic" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, or other sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through the addition of sugars or other sweeteners. Traditionally, Lambics are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. 			</body>

Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and flavors derived from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Aged beer is often blended with young beer to create this special style. Vanillin and other wood- derived flavors should not be present. Carbonation can be none (flat) to medium. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Very low with dry mouthfeel <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> While taking its inspiration from the Traditional Gueuze whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium, Contemporary Belgian-Style Spontaneous Fermented Ales may incorporate specialty malts, spices or other flavors or fruited combinations that influence the hue, flavor, and aroma of the finished beer such that they differ significantly from traditional examples. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as non-traditional malts, sweeteners used, other ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Malt sweetness should be absent, but sweetness of fruit may be low to high. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Hop aroma and flavor is not present. Cheesy hop character should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and flavors derived from Brettanomyces yeast are often present at moderate levels. Fermented sourness is an important part of the flavor profile, though sweetness may compromise the intensity. Fruit sourness may also be an important part of the profile. These flavored Lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Dry to full <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These beers, also known by the names Framboise, Kriek, Peche, Cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit aromas and flavors. Fruit Lambics, whose origin is the Brussels area of Belgium, are often simply called Fruit Lambic. Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be "Belgian-Style Fruit Lambics." The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional Lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit, or other sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars, or other sweeteners. See also Belgian-Style Lambic for additional background information. Such beers exhibiting wood-derived attributes should be categorized in other Wood-Aged categories. <br/><br/>
Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, fruit, or other ingredients. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying lambic beer upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Toast and caramel malt aroma and flavor may be present. Astringency from highly roasted malt should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low, with attributes typical of traditional non-hybrid European hop varieties. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> A cool ale fermentation is typically used. Extensive aging and acidification of this beer can mask malt and hop character to varying degrees. Aging in barrels may contribute some level of Brettanomyces and lactic character. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Medium to full <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> The style originated in Dortmund and is a strong, dark, hoppy ale which may or may not be sour. It may also be extensively aged in wooden barrels. Traditional versions may have a low or medium-low degree of smokiness. Adambier may or may not use wheat in its formulation. Smoke character may be absent in contemporary versions. Fruited versions of this style which exhibit attributes of wood-aging should be categorized as fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged Sour Beers. Fruited versions of this style which do not exhibit attributes of wood- aging should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Malt sweetness is medium to medium-high with a pronounced malt character. A high proportion of pale or dark wheat malt (as much as 80 percent) is used to brew these beers as well as Pilsener and other pale, toasted or dark specialty malts. Paler versions may have bready, aromatic biscuit malt attributes. Darker versions may exhibit roast malt bitterness at low levels, and toasted or nutty malt attributes. Caramel-like malt attributes are not present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Medium-low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Fruity esters may be present as these beers are fermented with ale yeast as opposed to wheat beer yeast. Diacetyl and phenolic aromas and flavors should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Full <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Traditional German wheat beer yeast is not used in this style of beer. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, competition organizers may choose to create subcategories which reflect pale and dark versions. 			</body>

<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Black <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Opaque. When clarity is perceivable, chill haze should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Malt sweetness is medium-low to medium-high. Distinctive malt aromas and flavors of caramelized sugars, dark sugars and licorice are present. Roast malt attributes may be present at low levels, but any bitterness or astringency should be in harmony with other flavor aspects. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low. Floral hop aroma can complement aromatics. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to medium-low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Due to its alcoholic strength, there may be very low to low levels of complex alcohol aromas and flavors and/or higher levels of fruitiness suggestive of berries, grapes, and plums, but not banana. Fruity esters, DMS and diacetyl should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Medium to full <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Baltic Porter is brewed with lager yeast and fermented and lagered cold producing a smooth beer. A low level of oxidation, if harmonious with other flavor components, is acceptable. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Malt attributes should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is based, but at lower overall intensity due to lower original gravity. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Hop attributes should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is based, but at lower overall intensity in order to maintain the balance typical of that style. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> This category includes beers of any style that 1) are at or below 5.0% abv (4.0% abw), and 2) have an original gravity and alcohol content below the range of the classic style as defined in these guidelines. These beers exhibit lower original gravity and alcohol content than the classic style. Drinkability is key to a successful session beer. Beers at or below 5.0% abv (4% abw) that adhere to the specifications of a classic style are not categorized as Session Beers. For example, low gravity beers such as Belgian-Style Table Beers, Belgian-Style Session Ales or English-Style Mild Ales should be categorized within their appropriate categories. Drinkability is key to a successful session beer. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may wish to further subcategorize this category. Competition organizers may request that brewers provide actual percent alcohol by volume (abv) for their entries in this category. 			</body>

			<name>Kentucky Common Beer</name>
			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Medium to deep amber <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Chill haze or yeast haze is acceptable <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Medium-low to medium. Sweet malt is the dominant flavor attribute. Notes of corn, caramel, toffee and/or bread may be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to medium. May exhibit floral or spicy attributes typical of early 20th century North American hop varieties. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Low to medium-low fruity esters may be present. Very low levels of DMS, if present, are acceptable. Diacetyl should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Medium-low to medium with a dry finish enhanced by high carbonation <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> This American-born regional style proliferated around Louisville, Kentucky, from the Civil War era until Prohibition. Corn grits or flakes were commonly used at a rate or 25-35% of the total grist. Minerally attributes resulted from the use of hard brewing water. These beers were consumed very young, going from brewhouse to consumer in as little as one week. Early 20th century brewing literature mentions a slight tartness developing during fermentation as a characteristic attribute of this style. If tartness is present in modern versions, it should be at very low levels. 			</body>

			<name>Kellerbier or Zwickelbier</name>
			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Varies depending on the underlying European origin lager or ale style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Typically slightly hazy to moderately cloudy, but may become clear through settling. A small amount of yeast haze is acceptable and traditional. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Varies depending on the underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Varies depending on underlying style. Low level attributes typical of late or dry hopping may be present in some versions. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Varies depending on underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Low levels of sulfur and acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation, if present, can enhance the flavor of these beers. Low fruity esters may be present and may vary slightly from the underlying style due to age and the presence of yeast. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but may be present at low levels in keller versions of beer styles which can contain diacetyl when fully aged, such as Bohemian-Style Lager. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Varies depending on underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Kellerbier or Zwickelbiers are unfiltered versions of lager or ale styles of European origin. These can include traditional Helles, Dunkel, Dortmunder, Vienna, Rotbier, Bohemian, Koelsch, Alt, as well as less common traditional or contemporary European-origin lager and ale styles. Kellerbiers have carbonation ranging from low to normal and may exhibit poor head retention. These beers are typically unfiltered, but they may be filtered and then redosed with yeast. Whether filtered or unfiltered these beers are packaged and served with very low to moderate amounts of yeast. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information should include the underlying European-origin lager or ale style upon which the entry is based. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on ale or lager yeast type or hue. 			</body>

			<name>American-Style Fruit Beer</name>
			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Can range from pale to very dark depending on the underlying style and is often influenced by the color of added fruit <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Clear or hazy is acceptable <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Not present to medium-low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Not present to medium-low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> In balance with fruit character and usually at very low to medium levels <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> American-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional German, British or American ale or lager yeast. Beers fermented with Belgian-style, German-style Hefeweizen or other South German wheat beer or Berliner-style Weisse yeasts should be categorized elsewhere. Fruit beers exhibiting sourness should be categorized elsewhere. Attributes typical of wild fermentation should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Varies with style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Within the framework of these guidelines, fruit beers fermented with Belgian yeast (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, Saison and/or Brettanomyces) should be categorized as Belgian-Style Fruit Beers, or possibly as fruited Brett Beers. Some beers may fit into this category if they contain fruity adjuncts but no actual fruit. As an example, a juniper berry-flavored beer with notable juniper berry fruity flavor and/or aroma could be categorized as a Fruit Beer, whereas a beer in which the juniper berry character is more herbal or spicy should be categorized as an Herb and Spice Beer. Fruit Beers brewed with wheat should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. Fruit Beers brewed with unusual fermentable(s), but no wheat, should be categorized as Fruit Beers. All of the various India Pale Ale or Imperial India Pale Ale styles brewed as Fruit Beers are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ales. All fruited Sour Beers are categorized elsewhere. All fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged beers whether sour or not are categorized elsewhere. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be categorized as Field Beers. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to medium-low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast depending on the underlying wheat beer style. Low fruity esters are typical. Diacetyl should not be present. In versions served with yeast, yeasty aroma and flavor should be low to medium. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> The grist should include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts contribute aroma and flavor expressing true fruit complexity. Versions served with yeast should demonstrate a full yeasty mouthfeel. Fruited examples of wheat beer styles that are not commonly brewed with fruit and do not exhibit attributes of wood aging should be categorized as Fruit Wheat Beers. These could include fruited versions of various wheat beer styles of European origin such as Weizens, Adambier or Grodziskie. Fruited wheat beers that exhibit sourness fall within various fruited sour beer categories. Such beers could deviate from parameters shown for those styles but should be suggestive of the underlying classic beer style with fruit added. Fruited versions of Berliner Weisse or Contemporary Gose fall within those categories as they are commonly brewed with fruit. Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be entered as Field Beers. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Can range from pale to dark depending on underlying Belgian style, and is often influenced by the color of added fruit <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Clear to hazy beer is acceptable <br/><br/>

<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying Belgian style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Acidic bacterial fermentation attributes may be absent or may be present; if present, such attributes contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Varies with style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle to intense, should be present and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian yeast, (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, etc.). Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be categorized as Field Beers. Fruit or fruit extracts, used as adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit character ranging from subtle to intense. Classifying these beers can be complex. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood-derived aromas and flavors such as vanillin should not be present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived from wood or liquids previously aged in wood should be categorized in other Wood-Aged Beer categories. Fruited Belgian-style beers which exhibit Brettanomyces may be categorized in this style when no other category exists for such beers. However, a fruited Saison exhibiting Brett character should be categorized as a Specialty Saison. A fruited version of a Brett Beer is categorized as Fruited Brett Beer when such a Brett-containing beer is not based on an existing underlying Belgian beer style. A Lambic-Style fruit beer should be categorized as a Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic. Fruited Belgian-Style beers brewed with additional adjuncts could fall in this category or perhaps as Experimental Beers. Fruit beers fermented with German, British or American ale or lager yeast should be categorized as American-Style Fruit Beers or as Fruit Wheat Beers. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low to very high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Specialty Beers are brewed with atypical fermentable sugars, grains and/or starches which contribute to alcohol content. The hallmark of Specialty Beers are the distinctive attributes of these special ingredients, which should be present in the aroma, flavor and overall balance of the beer. Examples could include maple syrup, agave, potatoes, wild rice, or any other sources of carbohydrate not commonly used in modern beer styles. Beers containing wheat are categorized in one of several wheat beer styles. The use of rice or corn would not normally be considered unusual since these adjuncts are commonly used in beer production. However, beers made with rice or corn varieties which imbue highly distinctive flavor attributes might be categorized as Specialty Beers. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Classifying these beers can be complex. Beers made with unusual fermentables, which also contain spices, fruits, or other ingredients and which therefore represent a combination of two or more hybrid beer styles are categorized as Experimental Beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, nuts generally impart much more flavor than fermentables, and beers containing nuts are categorized as Field Beers. Likewise, within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable and beers containing coconut are categorized as Field Beers. Beers brewed with honey are categorized as Specialty Honey Beers. Beers brewed with roots, seeds, flowers etc. which exhibit herbal and/or spicy characters are categorized as Herb and Spice Beers. While beers brewed with fruits or vegetables may derive fermentable carbohydrate from those sources, they are most appropriately categorized within various Fruit Beer or Field Beer categories. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as type or form of unusual carbohydrate source used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to medium-high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Low levels of spicy and fruity ester aromas are typical. Yeast-derived aroma and flavor attributes such as clove-like or other phenolics may be present when consistent with underlying beer style. These beers can be fermented with either ale or lager yeast. Diacetyl should not be present. Low to medium yeast aroma may be present in versions packaged with yeast. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to medium. Rye can impart textural qualities ranging from dry and crisp to smooth and velvety. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> The grist should include sufficient rye so that rye character is evident in the beer. Rye character is often described as spicy and/or black pepper-like and/or earthy. Beers brewed with rye that do not exhibit rye character should be categorized in other beer styles. Versions served with yeast should possess a full yeasty mouthfeel. <br/><br/>

<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Chill haze and/or haze from yeast is allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and flavors are present at low levels. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Low to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Medium to high fruity esters are present. Acidity resulting from Brettanomyces fermentation results in a complex flavor profile. Brettanomyces character, at low to high levels, should be present and expressed as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic aromas and flavors. Brettanomyces character may or may not be dominant. Acidity from Brettanomyces should be low to medium-low. Cultured yeast strains may be used in the fermentation. Beers fermented with Brettanomyces that do not exhibit attributes typical of Brettanomyces fermentation are categorized elsewhere. Beers in this style should not incorporate bacteria or exhibit a bacteria-derived flavor profile. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Low to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Fruited versions will exhibit fruit flavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood- derived flavors and aromas such as vanillin should not be present. Residual flavors and aromas originating from liquids previously aged in a barrel (bourbon, sherry, etc.) should not be present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived from wood or liquids previously aged in wood are categorized in Wood-Aged Beer categories. Sour wood- and barrel- aged versions are categorized in Wood-Aged Sour Beer categories.

<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These ales or lagers are brewed with freshly harvested hops. Such hops might be undried fresh or frozen cones or ground material, or, freshly kilned dried cones or pellets. These beers are typically consumed while fresh to highlight bright fresh hop attributes. Aging these beers will typically modify and reduce fresh-hop characters resulting in unique flavor outcomes. <br/><br/>
Competition organizers may create subcategories for ales and lagers, or which reflect groups of entries based on fresh hops in unprocessed, frozen, or kilned form. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as hop varieties used, unprocessed, frozen, or kilned, processing or timing of addition(s) (kettle, whirlpool, fermenter, aging tank, etc.), other ingredients used or other factors which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> These are any traditional or experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and exhibiting acidity derived from exposure to bacteria. These beers are aged in the presence of microflora (either present in the wood or introduced at some time in the brewing process) with the intention of introducing sourness to the beer. These beers are aged with the intention of developing unique attributes imparted by the wood and/or by liquids that had previously been stored in contact with the wood. Wood aging does not necessarily impart wood flavors but does result in distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of aroma, flavor and mouthfeel results from the marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by the wood or barrel, and with sourness and/or other attributes derived from bacteria. These beers may or may not have Brettanomyces character. For purposes of competition, entries made with fruit are categorized as Fruited Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Entries made with spices are categorized as Herb/Spice Beers. Entries made with combinations of and or fruit(s) and or spices and or other ingredients, and which therefore represent combinations of multiple hybrid beer styles, are categorized as Experimental Beer. <br/><br/>
Versions made with fruit(s) will exhibit attributes of wood-aging, acidity and those added fruit(s). Competition organizers may choose to create subcategories for Wood-aged sour beers made with fruit or other ingredients. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.

<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Aged Beers are any beers aged for over one year. A brewer may brew any type of beer of any strength and enhance its character with various aging conditions for an extended time. In general, beers with high hopping rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and/or complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels. Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel, aroma and flavor. Often, aged character is the result of oxidative reactions that either bring individual flavor components into harmony or are unique flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors often develop during aging, and hop character often changes. No matter what the effect, the overall character should be balanced and without aggressive flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary with the duration of aging and the underlying beer style. Mildly-flavored beers are more likely to develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation. Positive transformations are more likely to occur in beers with higher levels of hops, malt and/or alcohol. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Within the framework of these guidelines, various Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers which then undergo aging of one or more years in glass or stainless, and, which clearly exhibit sensory outcomes of that additional aging, may be categorized as Aged Beers. However, Brett Beers, Sour Beers or any other beers exhibiting attributes of aging in the presence of any microflora must be categorized elsewhere. Beers which have undergone aging but which nonetheless do not display characteristics of aging are categorized within their base styles. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as length of time aged, type of vessel, duration of aging process, other ingredients or other processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. 			</body>

<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Experimental beers are beers that 1. employ unique and unusual techniques and/or ingredients; or 2. beers that do not meet the criteria of individual existing categories, representing a combination of two or more hybrid, specialty or classic categories (with the exception of beers brewed with chili peppers). Experimental beers are primarily grain-based with a minimum of 51% of fermentable carbohydrates derived from malted grains. Beers produced using non-experimental techniques and/or ingredients are considered experimental beers if their properties overlap two or more existing categories and exhibit the distinctive characteristics of each of those categories. Uniqueness is the primary consideration when evaluating this category. Within the framework of these guidelines, field, fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty, wood-aged or other beers that fit within another individual category should not be categorized as experimental beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed with chili peppers are categorized as chili beers, and should not be categorized as experimental beers. When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying beer style(s) upon which the entry is based (if such style(s) is apparent), or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, hop varieties, microflora, fruit, spices or other ingredients, wood aging, etc. 			</body>

			<name>Experimental India Pale Ale</name>
			<body>
<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Straw to very dark, varying widely with ingredients used <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> May range from clear to very high degree of cloudiness. Starch, yeast, hop, protein and/or other compounds can contribute to a wide range of hazy appearance within this category <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low to medium-low malt aroma and flavor may be present, and may exhibit attributes typical of various adjuncts and specialty malts <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Medium to very high hop aroma and flavor are present, with attributes typical of hops from any origin <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Low to very high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Fruity esters are low to high and may contribute to an overall highly fruity impression regardless of the presence or absence of fruit(s) used and can contribute to the perception of sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile. Yeast choices can vary widely as can sensory outcomes; very low to low phenolic or other attributes typical of wine, champagne or Brettanomyces yeast strains may be present but are not required. Carbonation can range from average to high, with higher levels often associated with a crisp mouthfeel. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Very low to medium, depending on grist and yeast choice, enzymatic treatment, finishing adjunct(s) and other fermentation parameters. Mouthfeel can vary widely from light to full and from dry to silky. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Beers in this category recognize the cutting edge of American IPA brewing. Experimental India Pale Ales are either 1) any of White, Red, Brown, Brut or many other IPA or Imperial IPA types or combinations thereof currently in production, and fruited or spiced versions of these, or 2) fruited, spiced, wood- and barrel-aged or other elaborated versions of classic American and Juicy Hazy IPA, and Imperial IPA categories. They range widely in color, hop and malt intensity and attributes, hop bitterness, balance, alcohol content, body and overall flavor experience. Black versions of India Pale Ale that do not meet the specifications for American-Style Black Ale may be considered Experimental India Pale Ale. Fruited and spiced versions exhibit attributes typical of those ingredients, in harmony with hop impression and overall flavor experience. Lactose may be used to enhance body and balance, but should not lend to, or overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers. Classifying these beers can be complex. Within the framework of these guidelines, nuts generally impart much more flavor than fermentables, and beers containing nuts are categorized as Field Beers. Likewise, within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a vegetable, so beers containing coconut are categorized as Field Beers. Beers brewed with honey are categorized as Specialty Honey Beers. Spiced or fruited versions of these beers made with unusual fermentables are categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. Within the framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed with chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beers, and should not be categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries.

<big><b>Color</b></big><br/> Any color is acceptable. Versions made with fruits or other flavorings may take on corresponding hues. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Clarity</b></big><br/> Clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop haze. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Generally, these beers are highly attenuated resulting in very low to low malt character. Maltier versions should display good overall balance with other flavor components. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Very low to high <br/><br/>
<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Very low to low <br/><br/>
<big><b>Fermentation Characteristics</b></big><br/> Aromas may vary significantly due to fermentation attributes contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Wild beers are spontaneously fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air/environment near the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild Beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild Beers may or may not be perceived as acidic. They may include a highly- variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which they are fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body are important factors in assessing these beers. <br/><br/>
<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Very low to medium <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients should be categorized as Wild Beers. Within the framework of these guidelines, beers which hew to classic or traditional categories such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be categorized as such, rather than as Wild Beers. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include the underlying beer style(s) upon which the entry is based, or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes. Competition organizers may create subcategories which reflect groups of entries based on color, microflora, fruit, spices or other ingredients, wood aging, etc. 			</body>

<big><b>Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying style.

<big><b>Perceived bitterness</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying style <br/><br/>

<big><b>Body</b></big><br/> Varies with underlying style <br/><br/>
<big><b>Additional notes</b></big><br/> This category includes lagers, ales or other beers made from fermentable sugars, grains and converted carbohydrates and must also include some portion of cereal. All ingredients must be free of gluten. Within the framework of these guidelines, beers brewed with barley, wheat, spelt, rye, and other gluten-containing ingredients may not be categorized as Gluten-Free. Gluten-Free Beers may contain malted grains that are gluten-free. NOTE: These guidelines do not supersede any government regulations. Wine, mead, flavored malt beverages or beverages other than "beer" as defined by the TTB (U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau) are not considered “gluten-free beer” under these guidelines. Gluten-reduced beers’ original ingredients would have gluten content that has been reduced by enzymes or other processes to reduced levels. Gluten-reduced beers should be categorized in the classic style category most appropriate for the beer, rather than as Gluten-Free Beer. <br/><br/>
When using these guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be asked to provide supplemental information about entries in this category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might include an underlying beer style if appropriate, gluten free grains and/or other carbohydrate sources or other information unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing which influence perceived sensory outcomes such as microflora, fruit, spices or other ingredients, wood aging, etc. 			</body>

Due to their nature, non-alcohol malt beverages will have a profile lacking the complexity and balance of flavors that beers containing alcohol will display. N/A beers should be assessed with this is mind, and should not be given negative evaluations for reasons related to the absence of alcohol. <br/><br/>
