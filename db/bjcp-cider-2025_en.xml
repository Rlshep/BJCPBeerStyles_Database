                <i><strong>Cider</strong>
                    is the fermented juice of crushed apples. <strong>Perry</strong>
                    is a similar beverage made from pears. In the United States, a
                    distinction is made between hard cider (fermented, alcoholic) and
                    sweet cider (unfermented, non-alcoholic). Elsewhere in the world,
                    cider refers to the fermented product. We use the latter definition
                    within these guidelines.</i>

                <i>There
                    are four categories in these guidelines for cider and perry:
                </i>Traditional
                Cider <i>(Category C1), </i>Strong
                Cider<i> (Category C2), </i>Specialty
                Cider<i> (Category C3), and </i>Perry
                <i>(Category C4). See the
                    preamble to each category for more detailed descriptions. As with
                    beer, there is no requirement that competitions judge these
                    categories separately – individual styles may be grouped for
                    judging and award purposes. Do not attempt to infer any deeper
                    meaning from the names or groupings, as none is intended. </i>

                    <b>Aroma and Flavor</b>
                </big>
                <br/>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ciders
                        and perries do not necessarily present overtly fruity aromas or
                        flavors — in the same way that wine does not taste like grape
                        juice or beer does not smell like wort. Drier styles of cider can
                        develop a character that is more complex but less fruity. Cider and
                        perry should not taste like a cocktail of raw fruit juice,
                        carbonated water, and alcohol – they should taste <i>fermented</i>.</li>
                    <li>
                        Winemakers
                        classify smells as aroma (those derived from the ingredients) or
                        bouquet (those derived from the process of fermentation and aging).
                        Cider judges may benefit from thinking similarly, understanding how
                        the cidermaking process transforms the raw ingredients into the
                        finished product.</li>
                    <li>
                        A
                        clean fermentation profile is desirable in most styles, but this
                        does not necessarily mean the absence of <i><strong>yeast character</strong></i>.
                        Yeast can add estery notes or may have a light sulfury freshness;
                        these are not faults. Aging on yeast can contribute light nutty,
                        toasty, or bready notes.</li>
                    <li>
                        Some
                        cider styles exhibit distinctly <strong>non-</strong>fruity qualities, such
                        as the <i>smoky ham </i>undertones of a dry English cider. Some
                        regional styles have a rustic character.</li>
                    <li>
                        <i><strong>Sweetness</strong></i>
                        (residual sugar, or <strong>RS</strong>) ranges from absolutely dry (no RS)
                        up to as much as that of dessert wines (10% or more RS).
                        Approximate measurements of RS and final gravity (FG) for the
                        levels of sweetness are:</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Dry:
                            </strong>below 0.4% RS, FG less than 1.002. No perception of sweetness,
                            but the perception does not need to be bone dry.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Semi-dry:</strong>
                            0.4-0.9% RS, FG 1.002-1.004. There is a hint of sweetness but the
                            perception is still primarily dry. Also known as <i>medium-dry</i>
                            or <i>off-dry</i>.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Medium:</strong>
                            0.9-2.0% RS, FG 1.004-1.009. Sweetness is now a notable component
                            of the overall balance.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Semi-sweet:</strong>
                            2.0-4.0% RS, FG 1.009-1.019. The perception is sweet but still
                            refreshing. Also known as <i>medium-sweet</i>.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sweet:</strong>
                            above 4.0% RS, FG over 1.019. Like a dessert wine. Must not
                            be syrupy or cloying.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                These
                numbers are meant to assist in entry decisions and to normalize
                regional perception differences, not be used as a disqualifying
                factor by judges. When close to the boundary between sweetness
                levels, enter based on the overall impression and how well it
                matches the descriptions for these levels.

                Be
                aware that other factors (acidity, tannin, alcohol, dryness, other
                ingredients, etc.) affect the perception of sweetness. Do not rely
                solely on RS levels.

                When
                judging, arrange samples in order of increasing sweetness.
                Understand that sweetness can mask faults — be more attentive to
                this in sweeter ciders. Likewise, do not overly penalize dry ciders
                for minor faults that may only be more evident due to the lack of
                sweetness.


                In
                sweeter examples, non-fruity components of taste — particularly
                acidity and tannin — must complement the sweetness, or they will
                seem <i>cloying</i> (syrupy, heavily sweet) or <i>flabby</i>
                (sweetness unbalanced by acidity).
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <i><strong>Acidity</strong></i>
                        is an essential element of balance giving a clean, lively, bright,
                        juicy, refreshing impression without being puckering. Acidity (from
                        malic acid, and in some cases, lactic or other acids) must not be
                        confused with acetification (from ethyl acetate or acetic acid —
                        vinegar). The acrid aroma and tingling taste of volatile acidity
                        (acetification) is a fault in most styles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i><strong>Tannin</strong></i>
                        supplies astringency, body, and sometimes bitterness, which
                        contribute to balance, structure, and drinkability. Excessive
                        bitterness from tannin is a fault, whether from process or from
                        ingredients. Table fruit typically has low tannin levels.</li>
                    <li>
                        Ciders
                        may undergo a <i><strong>malolactic fermentation </strong></i>(MLF), which
                        reduces acidity by converting sharp malic acid into softer,
                        rounder, less-acidic lactic acid. The result should not be flabby
                        or too soft – the cider must remain refreshing. Perries should
                        not undergo MLF because acetification may result.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                MLF
                can produce clean flavors, but MLF of tannic cider apples often
                produces ethyl-phenols with spicy, smoky, smoked meat, phenolic,
                barnyard, funky, leathery, or horsey flavors. Do not expect most or
                all of these descriptors simultaneously. Restrained, balanced levels
                are optional but desirable in some regional styles.


                MLF
                is often mis-perceived as <i>Brettanomyces (Brett)</i>, since they
                share many common descriptors, but <i>Brett</i> contamination is a
                serious fault. A dominating funky barnyard character from <i>Brett</i>
                is undesirable.

                Judges
                should be attentive to the possible <i>mousy</i> fault (THP,
                tetrahydropyridine), which is more likely in a higher pH cider that
                has undergone MLF. (For judges unable to detect the mousy<i> </i>fault<i>,</i>
                an alkaline oral rinse may be needed to confirm.)

                        Clarity
                        may range from good to brilliant. The lack of sparkling clarity is
                        not a fault, but visible particles are undesirable. In some styles,
                        a rustic lack of brilliance is common. Perries are notoriously
                        difficult to clear; as a result, a slight haze is not a fault.
                        However, a sheen in either cider or perry often indicates the early
                        stages of lactic contamination and is a distinct fault.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Carbonation
                        can vary from completely still to soda-like (<i>spumante</i>).
                        Little to no carbonation is termed <strong>still</strong>, but may give a
                        slight <i>tickle </i>on the tongue – it does not have to be dead
                        flat. Moderate carbonation is termed <strong>pétillant</strong>. Highly
                        carbonated is termed <strong>sparkling</strong>. At the higher carbonation
                        levels, the <i>mousse</i> (head) may be retained for a short time.
                        However, gushing, foaming, and difficult-to-manage heads are
                        faults.</li>
                    <li>
                        A
                        cider or perry without additional ingredients is often a pale
                        color, typically straw to gold. Be aware that some red-fleshed
                        apples such as Redfield will give a blush or rosé hue that should
                        not be misinterpreted as coming from other fruit; when in doubt,
                        check the declared apple varieties. Dull, brownish shades can be an
                        indication of oxidation, although darker tones could come from
                        using low acid apples, keeving, aging or fermenting on wood, using
                        concentration processes, or other reasons. Do not automatically
                        assume oxidation by color alone. Obviously, examples containing
                        added ingredients usually reflect the color of those additions.</li>

                        In
                        general, cider and perry have a body and fullness akin to a light
                        wine. Most cider styles have much less body than that of most beer.
                        Some perries will have fuller bodies due to sorbitol (an
                        unfermentable sugar alcohol), which can add a perception of
                        sweetness.</li>

                        Highly
                        sparkling ciders can seem Champagne-like. Still ciders may seem
                        lacking to novices since carbonation livens the presentation.
                        Properly declared still ciders should not be penalized for lack of
                        carbonation.</li>
                    <li>
                        Tannin
                        can affect mouthfeel by adding body, adding bitterness, or by
                        increasing the perceived dryness of the finish. Tannic styles can
                        have a pleasantly astringent mouthfeel resembling a red wine. Wine
                        descriptors such as drying, fuzzy, or grippy may apply. An
                        impression of wood, leather, dried leaves, or apple skins may also
                        be present, with accompanying flavor effects.</li>

                        used in cider-making are commonly classified by acidity and tannin:
                        <i><strong>Sweet</strong></i> (low acidity, low tannin), <i><strong>Sharp</strong></i>
                        (high acidity, low tannin), <i><strong>Bittersweet</strong></i> (low acidity,
                        high tannin), or <i><strong>Bittersharp</strong></i> (high acidity, high

                        present in the milling and pressing equipment) or <i>cultured
                    </i>(added by the cidermaker). MLF is allowed using either of these

                        as an adjunct in most styles either to adjust starting or finishing
                        gravity. Honey additions generally result in either a C3C
                        Experimental Cider, a C4D Experimental Perry, or an M2A Cyser (see
                        Mead Style Guidelines). Review individual style descriptions for

                        processing aids and enzymes are generally allowed as long as they
                        are not perceivable in the finished product. Enzymes may be used to
                        clarify juice before fermentation. Malic acid may be added to
                        low-acid juice to raise acidity to a level safe for avoiding
                        bacterial contamination and off-flavors (typically pH 3.8 or
                        below).</li>

                        safe level (200 mg/l) must be strictly observed. Any excess sulfite
                        detectable as <i>burnt match</i> in the finished product is a
                        serious fault.

                        may be added at bottling to stabilize the cider. However, any
                        residual aroma or flavor from overuse of sorbate (e.g., a geranium
                        note) is problematic.</li>

                        sweeteners or fresh juice. Back-sweetened products must be stable.
                        Turbidity, gushing, or foaming resulting from post-packaging
                        fermentation are considered serious faults.</li>

                        Barrel
                        fermentation in oak is a traditional method for many cider styles,
                        but those barrels are reused so a strong, fresh oak character is
                        not expected in the final product. <i>Relatively neutral wood may
                        be used to ferment or age any style</i>. However, this means that
                        any wood character in the finished cider must be at no more than a
                        background level. The use of wood does not automatically imply a
                        specialty or experimental style; however, the intensity of the wood
                        character does.</li>
                    <li>
                        Examples
                        with a substantial wood or barrel character should be entered in
                        either C3C Experimental Cider or C4D Experimental Perry, unless the
                        style specifically allows it. When using wood in this manner,
                        declare the species of wood, and the process used (e.g., barrel,
                        chips, staves, strips, spirals).</li>

                Ciders are produced through fermenting apples without additional
                ingredients or unusual processes, and represent the regional
                traditions from many apple-growing areas of the world. The use of a
                geographic name in a style title does not imply an appellation –
                ciders inspired by the originals may be produced anywhere, as long as
                they have a similar sensory profile.

                    A
                    <strong>Common Cider</strong> is made primarily from culinary (table) apples.
                    Compared to most other styles in this category, these ciders are
                    generally lower in tannin and higher in acidity.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <big>
                        <b>Overall Impression</b>
                    </big>
                    <br/>A refreshing drink with the fruity and floral aroma
                    of apples, and a bright, juicy acidity. Fresh, with a clean
                    fermentation, but possibly showing a slight yeast character.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <big>
                        <b>Aroma and Flavor</b>
                    </big>
                    <br/>Apple character noticeable, either as the flavor of
                    the fruit or as a fruity-floral aroma. Sweet or low-alcohol ciders
                    may have noticeable apple aroma and flavor. Dry ciders will be more
                    neutral-flavored and wine-like with some apple-derived esters and
                    floral notes. Apple-derived esters are not necessarily apple-like;
                    other fruit notes are possible (similar to what occurs when grapes
                    are fermented into wine). Sweetness and acidity should combine to
                    give a refreshing character. Medium to high acidity adds a
                    refreshing quality, but must not be harsh or biting. Restrained
                    tannin may contribute to an increased perception of dryness in the
                    finish. Generally clean fermentation without the rustic or MLF notes
                    of some other regional ciders. Light yeast character acceptable.

                    <br/>Slightly cloudy to brilliant. Color ranges from very pale straw
                    to medium gold. Red-fleshed apple varieties can produce ciders with
                    a blush hue.

                    </big>
                    <br/>Medium-light to medium body. Light tannin can provide a slight
                    to medium-low astringency, but little bitterness. Any level of
                    carbonation.

                    <br/>A refreshing drink of some substance – neither bland nor watery.
                    Sweet ciders must not be cloying. Dry ciders must not be too austere
                    (subtle, muted, tight fruit flavor with high acidity). Sometimes
                    called New World Cider or Modern Cider. The name <i>common</i>
                    implies lack of rarity, not lack of quality or class. Common cider
                    may use heirloom apple varieties, if they do not have appreciable
                    tannin levels, significant non-fruity character, or unusual
                    intensity – ciders with these qualities are best entered in other
                    Traditional Cider styles.

                    <strong>Heirloom
                        Cider </strong>is a broadly-defined style that often uses at least some
                    cider apples to create a product having more tannin than Common
                    Cider. It is usually made outside the regions associated with
                    English, French, and Spanish Cider styles, and lacks the
                    distinguishing MLF or rustic characteristics of those styles. It is
                    a type of ‘craft’ cider produced in North America, eastern
                    England, and elsewhere in the world.

                    <br/>Combining the apple character and acidity of a
                    Common Cider with the tannin of an English or French Cider, while
                    retaining a clean fermentation profile.

                    <br/>
                    The intensity of apple character, esters, and
                    sweetness typically varies with the sweetness level. Heirloom
                    variety cider apples may bring their own unique, often rustic,
                    qualities. Acidity can be moderate to high. Tannins can be
                    medium-low to medium-high. Tannins may add to the impression of
                    dryness in the finish, while contributing flavors that are
                    reminiscent of wood, leather, or apple skins. Acidity and tannin
                    together balance the sweetness and provide structure to the cider;
                    they are both typically present, and do not have to be at equal
                    levels. Has a clean fermentation profile without MLF-derived phenol
                    or barnyard character. Mousiness is a serious fault. Light yeast
                    character acceptable.

                    <br/>Slightly cloudy to brilliant. Color ranges from straw to deep
                    gold. Red-fleshed apple varieties can produce ciders with a blush
                    hue.

                    <br/>Medium to full body, depending on tannin level. Any astringency
                    and bitterness from tannin should be no more than moderate. Any

                    <br/>Probably most similar to English Cider, but without any MLF phenols
                    or barnyard character, and having a higher acid balance. Sometimes
                    called Heritage Cider or Traditional Cider. The name <i>heirloom</i>
                    implies the use of older, not-widely-grown cider apple varieties,
                    not that there is some added prestige, especially relative to Common
                    Cider.

                    <strong>English Cider</strong>
                    is a regional product originating in the West Country, a
                    group of counties in the southwest of England. Made from bittersweet
                    and bittersharp apples, it is higher in tannin and lower in acidity
                    than Common Cider. It may optionally have a phenolic-smoky character
                    from intentional MLF. Not all cider from England fits this category;
                    some are in the Heirloom Cider style.

                    </big>
                    <br/>Full-bodied and often seeming quite dry with a long
                    finish from high tannin content. The fruit expression may seem
                    subtle due to a lower estery apple character than most styles, but
                    the fruit-derived flavor profile can be complex but non-fruity. Can
                    optionally have a phenolic, smoky, or light barnyard MLF complexity.

                        <b>Aroma and Flavor</b>
                    </big>
                    <br/>
                    The intensity of apple character tends to be subtle,
                    but not absent. Esters and tannins can suggest apples without being
                    overtly apple-flavored. This style often uses fruit giving
                    significantly spicy, earthy, non-fruity flavors that are much
                    different than those from common table apples. Acidity tends to be
                    lower (especially if MLF has been conducted), with tannin providing
                    much of the structure. Tannins can be moderate to high, and can add
                    flavors reminiscent of leather, wood, dried leaves, or apple skins.

                    MLF
                    may add a desirable phenolic or barnyard character, with spicy,
                    smoky, phenolic, leathery, or horsey qualities. These flavor notes
                    are positive but are <strong>not</strong> required. If present, they must not
                    dominate; in particular, the phenolic and farmyard notes should not
                    be heavy. A strong farmyard character without spicy, smoky, or
                    phenolic notes suggests a <i>Brett</i> contamination, which is a
                    fault. Mousiness is a serious fault.

                    <br/>Sweeter examples exist, but dry is most traditional, particularly
                    when considering the drying contributions of tannin.

                    <strong>French Cider</strong>
                    is a regional product originating in the northwest of
                    France, predominantly Normandy and Brittany. Made using bittersweet
                    and bittersharp apples, it can have a higher tannin level, but it is
                    often made sweeter to balance. The French also use MLF as do the
                    English, but the character is often lower. Salts may be adjusted and
                    nutrients may be deprived to arrest fermentation.

                    </big>
                    <br/>Medium to sweet, full-bodied, rich. Somewhat fruity.
                    May have a background level of phenolic, smoky, or farmyard
                    character.

                    </big>
                    <br/>Fruity, often fairly sweet with a full, rich flavor.
                    The sweetness and tannin combine to give a palate fullness that
                    often delivers considerable apple flavor. Tannins can dry the finish
                    slightly. MLF notes of spicy-smoky, phenolic, lightly funky, and
                    farmyard are common but not required (just as with English Cider),
                    but must not be pronounced if present.

                    deeper than other traditional styles. Higher carbonation levels may
                    create a brief foam stand similar to soda.

                    mainly as palate fullness and astringency rather than bitterness.
                    Carbonation moderate to champagne-like, but at higher levels it must
                    not gush or foam.

                    Typically made sweet to balance the tannin levels from the
                    traditional apple varieties. The French technique of <i>défécation
                </i>(<i>keeving</i> in English) can be used to slow fermentation by
                    depriving nutrients. Some may approximate this by back-sweetening
                    with juice. Commercial examples are frequently carbonated in the
                    bottle. The French expect a subtler MLF character than do the
                    English. Known as <i>Cidre</i> in French, and often sold by
                    sweetness level.

                    <strong>Spanish Cider</strong> is a regional product originating in the north of Spain,
                    predominantly in Asturias, Cantabria, and Basque regions. Produced
                    from sharp and bittersharp apples using a natural co-fermentation of
                    yeast and bacteria. Often exhibits a wild note, with elevated
                    volatile acidity (ethyl acetate or acetic acid) that traditionally

                    Each Spanish cider-producing region has its own traditions and
                    products, but these are combined within this broad style. Basque
                    cider is more earthy, leathery, and woody, with more bitterness and
                    a stronger sourness compared to the milder, floral and fruity
                    Asturias cider. Traditionally slow-fermented in chestnut vessels
                    with wild and acetic notes coming from the natural process.
                    Typically enjoyed young. Traditional ciders are called <i>Sidra
                    Natural</i>, and only have residual carbonation from fermentation.
                    Sparkling sidras are a modern product using secondary refermentation
                    in the bottle. Known as <i>Sidra</i> in Spanish and <i>Sagardoa</i>
                    in Basque. <strong>Ciders that are simply infected or vinegary should not
                    be entered in this style.</strong> If volatile acidity is noted, judges
                    may attempt to liberate it by pouring the cider between tasting
                    glasses or by using a Spanish Cider or wine aerator. Do not attempt
                    theatrical pours during competitions.

                Ciders use either sugary adjuncts or concentration processes to
                increase the final alcohol content to levels above those typically
                attainable from fermenting only unadulterated sweet cider. These
                additional ingredients or processes have noticeable effects on the
                finished profile of the ciders, in addition to simply increasing the
                alcohol level. The name of the category should not be interpreted as
                implying that every example is necessarily stronger in alcohol than
                every Traditional Cider style.

                    This
                    cider is made using traditional New England apples with relatively
                    high acidity, and adjuncts to raise alcohol levels and contribute
                    additional flavor notes. New England is a multi-state region in the
                    northeast United States, east of New York state.

                    <br/>Substantial body and character. Typically is
                    relatively dry, but can be somewhat sweet if in balance and not
                    containing hot alcohol. Sometimes has a barrel character. Often has
                    flavors from adjuncts, especially raisins.

                    </big>
                    <br/>A flavorful cider with robust apple character,
                    strong but neutral alcohol, and derivative flavors from adjuncts and
                    sugar additives. Traditionally dry, but sweetness can be present to
                    balance stronger flavors. If sugary adjuncts have a flavor or aroma,
                    those should be balanced with the apple flavor and not dominate. A
                    raisin-like flavor is common. Any barrel or wood character should be
                    restrained, not dominant. Tannins can add to the dryness of the
                    finish. Acid levels are moderate to high, and should be in balance
                    with other flavors. Alcohol should not be hot or harsh. There are
                    many possible flavors present; the best examples show an integration
                    and harmonization between components.

                    <br/>Adjuncts may include any of white sugar, brown sugar, molasses,
                    maple syrup, or small amounts of honey. Raisins are common. These
                    adjuncts are intended to raise the OG well above what could be
                    achieved by apples alone. Sometimes barrel-aged, which can add an
                    oak character similar to a barrel-aged wine. If the barrel
                    previously held spirits, some of their flavor notes (e.g., whisky,
                    rum) may be present, but must be subtle and balanced. New England
                    Cider is a traditional style; do not interpret it to mean any cider
                    from New England. It also has nothing to do with New England (Hazy)
                    IPA.

                    A
                    cider fermented with added neutral sugar that increases the starting
                    gravity, and thus the resulting alcohol, to levels well above those
                    typical for Common Cider. The amount of added sugar is greater than
                    what could be used in other styles to compensate for low gravity.
                    Uses no fruit other than apples, and uses only sugar to increase the
                    starting gravity.

                    <br/>Dry versions may seem lighter in body than other ciders, because
                    higher alcohol levels are derived from sugar additions rather than
                    juice. Carbonation may range from still to Champagne-like. Typically
                    has a light alcohol warmth.

                    <br/>Differs from a New England Cider by using flavorless adjuncts.
                    Sugar is added for <i>chaptalization</i>, or increasing the gravity
                    of the juice in order to create more alcohol; it is not intended to
                    increase residual sweetness. Does not contain grapes or fruit other
                    than apples. Not related to <i>Apfelwein</i>, which is a German word
                    for cider. Fortified or distilled products should not be entered in
                    this style. Some commercial examples may be labeled as applewine
                    based on ABV levels and local laws; when seeking examples, pay
                    attention to the profile, not the labeling.

                    <br/>Fruity, with a depth and complexity of apple flavor.
                    Smooth, rich, sweet, and dessert wine-like but with a balancing
                    acidity, like in a Sauternes or other high-quality dessert wine.
                    Acidity must be high enough to prevent it from being cloying. Has a
                    bright character when fresh. Age can bring a deeper complexity with
                    a darker fruit and sugar character, but this should not seem
                    strongly caramelized. Noticeable volatile acidity, typically
                    perceived as acetone, is a fault.

                    <br/>The character differs from Applewine in that the ice cider process
                    increases not only sugar (and hence, potential alcohol) but also
                    acidity and all fruit flavor components proportionately. Differs
                    from Fire Cider in that it lacks deeply caramelized flavors, but has
                    a higher acidity to balance the sweetness. No additives are
                    permitted in this style; in particular, sweeteners may not be used
                    to increase gravity. This style originated in Quebec in the 1990s.

                and fermented from boiled, concentrated juice. Fermentation may be
                intentionally arrested or stopped while a substantial amount of
                residual sugar is present. No additives are permitted; in
                particular, sweeteners may not be used to increase gravity.
                Commercial versions may be aged for up to five years prior to
                release.

                    A dark gold to brown cider with a very sweet,
                    caramelized, maple sugar-like impression. Well-aged versions often
                    exhibit a dark fruit or sherry-like character.

                    <br/>Deep, sweet aroma of caramelized sugars that can
                    have a character like maple syrup or brown sugar, with hints of
                    caramel, dried apricots, baked apples, or butterscotch. Aged
                    versions may have elements of dark fruits and often exhibit a
                    sherry-like character. A very light smoke-like character, if
                    present, is not a fault. Acidity and tannins are typically
                    restrained in the balance. High to very high sweetness, yet not
                    cloying. Up to moderate alcohol may be present, but must be
                    well-integrated.

                    examples can have moderate tannin levels, but not to the point where
                    they seem overly astringent or harsh. Carbonation typically still to
                    moderate. Alcohol warmth may be perceived at a low to moderately-low
                    level, sometimes less obvious than the strength would otherwise
                    indicate. Well-aged examples can exhibit a characteristic

                    <br/>Caramelization is desirable, but scorched or burnt flavors are a
                    fault. Differs from Ice Cider in that it should have a character
                    from caramelization, and the acidity is generally lower in the
                    balance.

        <notes>
            Specialty Cider includes those ciders with added flavorings or using processes not already described in categories C1 and C2. These ciders do not necessarily need a declared base style as is expected in some specialty beer styles, but they do need to use a perceptible form of cider as the base. The result must be recognizable as a cider with a pleasant integration of the specialty aspect into a coherent, synergistic end product. Declaring a base style is allowable, but understand that judges will then also judge the cider relative to that base style. Entries with undeclared base styles still should have a cider character. In the context of this category, the term fruit is defined as having the same usage as in the preamble to category 29 Fruit Beer in the 2021 BJCP Beer Style Guidelines. Likewise, the term spice is defined as in category 30 Spiced Beer, including allowing the use of any spices, herbs, or vegetables.
        </notes>
        <notes>The same general characteristics and fault descriptions apply to Specialty Ciders as to Traditional Ciders (category C1), with the exception of allowable added ingredients. See the Introduction to Cider and Perry Styles for detailed sensory characteristics that apply to all styles.

                A
                cider with additional non-apple fruit or fruit juices added. This is
                the correct style to enter a beverage fermented from a combination
                of apple and pear juice.

                </big>
                <br/>A pleasant integration of cider and added fruit. The
                apple character and the added fruit must be noticeable, balanced,
                and complementary. If a base style is declared, should show some
                evidence of that style<i>. If no base style is declared, assume to
                be a Common Cider.</i>

                <br/>
                The cider character must be present and must meld
                well with the other declared fruits. The fruit character can seem
                like fresh fruit or somewhat jam-like, but should always have a
                fermented quality. It is a fault if the added fruit completely
                dominates the cider, the fruit seems like raw unfermented juice, or
                the cider otherwise tastes artificial. Oxidation of the base cider
                or of the fruit is a fault, but the cider can have a fresh or aged
                character.

                <br/>Clear to brilliant, as appropriate for the base style. Color
                appropriate to added fruit, but should not show brownish or dull
                oxidation characteristics (for example, red berries should give
                red-to-purple color, not orange). Fruit varieties can come in a
                range of colors often broader than those traditionally associated
                with the declared fruit.

                A
                cider with any combination of “botanicals” added. Hopped ciders
                are allowable in this category, in addition to ciders with the
                spices, herbs, and vegetables referenced in the Specialty Cider
                preamble.

                <br/>A
                pleasant integration of cider and added spices. The apple character
                must combine with the botanicals to give a balanced result. If a
                base style is declared, should show some evidence of that style.

                <br/>
                The apple character and added botanicals must both
                be noticeable and complementary. As with a fruit cider, it is a
                fault if the botanicals dominate or seem artificial. Likewise, harsh
                or raw spice flavors are undesirable. Hops, if used, should have a
                fresh, green character, not a grassy, vegetal quality. Note that
                some botanicals are stronger than others. Oxidation of either the
                special ingredients or the base cider is a fault.

                the effect of added botanicals but must not be bitter from
                over-extraction. Some ingredients may contribute tannins,
                bitterness, sourness, or other effects.

                <br/>The final product must retain a cider character from the apples.
                Hopped ciders typically display a fresh ‘dry hop’ character, not
                bitterness, from the hops. The description of the cider is critical
                information for judges, and should be sufficient for them to
                understand the concept. If special ingredients are declared, they
                should be perceived (exception: potential allergens do not need to
                be perceivable, but must be declared).

                This
                is an open-ended, catch-all category for cider with other
                ingredients or processes that do not fit any of the previous cider
                styles in categories C1 through C3. It also may be used for any
                other type of historical or regional traditional cider not already
                described. If the cider fits a previous style description, then it
                is not an Experimental Cider.

                The cider character must always be present, and must
                fit with added ingredients or process effects. If a spirit barrel
                was used, the character of the spirit (rum, whiskey, etc.) may range
                from subtle (barely recognizable) to balanced and complementary
                (short of dominating and overwhelming the cider character). Overall
                balance and drinkability are the critical success factors for this
                style. The resulting cider should contain recognizable experimental
                components, and be pleasant to drink.

                Regardless

                Experimental
                cider may exceed the typical Vital Statistics ranges for declared

                    <br/>
                    There is a fruity pear character, which can be mild
                    but increases in sweeter examples. The pear character reflects
                    flavors expected of fermented table pears, which may not taste
                    strongly like fresh pears. Drier versions tend toward a profile
                    similar to a young white wine. The acidity level should be mild to
                    balanced, not sharp. Tannins can be mild to balanced, but should not
                    add significant bitterness. The balance of acid and tannins is
                    variable, but is generally even to acid-forward. Should not be
                    mousy, ropy, or oily.

                    <br/>Compared to Heirloom Perry, Common Perry has less tannin, more
                    of a table fruit character, and can have more acidity. Some table
                    pears contain significant amounts of sorbitol, which may give a dry
                    perry an impression of sweetness. The perception of sorbitol as
                    <i>sweet</i> is highly variable from one person to the next. Hence,
                    entrants should specify sweetness according to actual residual sugar
                    amount, and judges must be aware that they might perceive more
                    sweetness than how the perry was entered. Back-sweetening with raw
                    pear juice to achieve a recognizable flavor profile can be found in
                    commercial examples, but this is not necessarily authentic or
                    expected in perry from areas with a long, continuous tradition. The
                    name <i>common</i> implies lack of rarity, not lack of quality or
                    class. Sometimes called New World Perry or Modern Perry.

                    A
                    traditional perry made from “perry pears” grown specifically for
                    that purpose, rather than for eating or cooking. Many of these
                    varieties are nearly inedible due to high tannins; some are also
                    quite hard. Perry pears may contain substantial amounts of sorbitol,
                    a non-fermentable, sweet-tasting sugar alcohol. Hence a perry can
                    exhibit the impression of sweetness, yet be completely dry (no RS).

                    </big>
                    <br/>Tannic and somewhat fruity, with a fuller body.
                    English examples tend to be drier than French examples, so the
                    sweetness level is variable. English and French examples may be
                    carbonated to higher levels.

                    <br/>
                    There is a noticeable fermented pear character,
                    which can be subtle to quite fruity. The pear character can be more
                    complex than a Common Perry, and does not taste strongly of table
                    pears. The impression often tends toward that of a young white wine.
                    A slight tannic bitterness is possible. The acidity level should be
                    balanced, not sharp, as typically more tannin is present than
                    acidity. Sorbitol may contribute to the impression of sweetness.
                    Should not be mousy, ropy, or oily. Perry can sometimes have a very
                    low level of natural acetification, which is unrelated to
                    contamination.

                    <br/>Relatively full body. Moderate to high tannin apparent as
                    astringency. Sorbitol can provide a smooth and slick texture. Should
                    not seem syrupy.

                    </big>
                    <br/>Compared to Common Perry, Heirloom Perry is more tannin-forward,
                    may have some bitterness, and has a more complex pear flavor. Note
                    that a <i>dry</i> perry may give an impression of sweetness due to
                    sorbitol in the pears, and perception of sorbitol as <i>sweet</i> is
                    highly variable from one person to another. Hence entrants should
                    specify sweetness according to actual residual sugar amount, and
                    judges must be aware that they might perceive more sweetness than
                    how the perry was entered. Back-sweetening with raw pear juice to
                    achieve a recognizable flavor profile can be found in some
                    commercial examples, but this is not necessarily authentic or
                    expected in perry from areas with a long, continuous tradition.
                    Sometimes called Traditional Perry or Heritage Perry. The name
                    <i>heirloom</i> implies the use of older, not-widely-grown perry
                    pear varieties, not that there is some added prestige, especially
                    relative to Common Perry.

                    A
                    regional style (Poiré de Glace) originating in Quebec in the 2000s,
                    often produced by cideries or domaines
                    where ice cider is made using a similar process. Pear juice is
                    frozen before fermentation to concentrate sugars. Fermentation is
                    often arrested before completion to achieve the desired sweetness
                    level. Sweeteners must not be used to adjust the starting or
                    finishing gravity.

                    <br/>
                    Fruity, smooth, sweet-tart. The fruit aroma is clear
                    and bright, often like poached pears, fruit preserves, or candied
                    peaches. The light to moderate fruit flavors can seem like pears
                    that have been cooked, dried, preserved, candied, or caramelized.
                    The soft, rounded finish may have additional notes of honey, nuts,
                    pastries, or tropical fruit. Acidity must be sufficient to prevent
                    it from seeming to be cloying. May be tannic (astringent or bitter)
                    but this should be slight to moderate at most. Should not be mousy,
                    ropy, or oily. Noticeable acetone is a fault. Only very slight
                    acetification is acceptable.

                    <br/>Gold to amber color. Clear to crystal clear. Usually still, but
                    light evidence of carbonation is allowed.

                    <br/>Full body. Supple, smooth texture, with a very long, silky
                    finish. Alcohol warmth is light to moderately low, although may not
                    be perceivable due to the sweetness. Most examples are still, but a
                    light carbonation is acceptable.

                    This
                    is an open-ended, catch-all category for perry with other
                    ingredients or for perry using other processes that result in a
                    product not fitting any other C4 styles, such as pear-based versions
                    of C3A and C3B (fruited or spiced perry). It may also be used for
                    any other type of historical or regional traditional perry not
                    already described, or for perry that otherwise meets existing
                    guideline definitions, except that it is noticeably outside listed
                    style parameters (e.g., strength, sweetness, carbonation). If the
                    perry fits a previously defined style, then it is not an
                    Experimental Perry.
                    Products
                    derived from other pome fruit (e.g., quince) including those
                    berry-like fruit in the Amelanchier genus (e.g., juneberry,
                    serviceberry, saskatoon berry) may be entered here in lieu of a
                    separate category, provided the experimental fruit is dominant in
                    the formulation.

                    The perry character must always be present, and must
                    fit with added ingredients or process effects. If a spirit barrel
                    was used, the character of the spirit (rum, whiskey, etc.) may range
                    from subtle (barely recognizable) to balanced and complementary
                    (short of dominating and overwhelming the perry character). Overall
                    balance and drinkability are the critical success factors for this
                    style. The resulting perry should contain recognizable experimental
                    components, and be pleasant to drink.

                    </big>
                    <br/>Clear to brilliant. Color should be that of a standard perry
                    unless other declared ingredients or processes contribute color.

                    <br/>If a base style has been declared, the body and mouthfeel should
                    be reflective of that style. Declared ingredients or processes may
                    result in additional body, or in increased tannic, astringent,
                    bitter, or other characteristics.

                    <br/>If a mixture of fruit is used, the perry character must remain
                    dominant. Regardless of experimental nature, the resulting beverage
                    must be recognizable as a perry. The description of the perry is
                    critical information for judges, and should be sufficient to allow
                    them to understand the concept. If special ingredients are declared,
                    they should be perceived (exception: potential allergens do not need
                    to be perceivable, but must be declared).
