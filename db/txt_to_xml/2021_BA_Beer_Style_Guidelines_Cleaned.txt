Compiled by the Brewers Association, copyright: 1993 through and including 2021. With 
Style Guideline Committee assistance and review by Chris Swersey, Paul Gatza, Chuck Skypeck, 
Kaylyn Kirkpatrick, Chris Williams, Andrew Sparhawk and Dan Rabin, and suggestions from 
Great American Beer Festival® and World Beer Cup&amp;#8480; judges, brewers, beer writers and beer 
lovers from around the world. 

Since 1979 the Brewers Association has provided beer style descriptions as a reference for 
brewers and beer competition organizers. Much of the early work was based on the assistance 
and contributions of beer journalist Michael Jackson; more recently these guidelines were 
greatly expanded, compiled, and edited by Charlie Papazian. The task of creating a realistic set 
of guidelines is always complex. The beer style guidelines developed by the Brewers 
Association use sources from the commercial brewing industry, beer analyses, and 
consultations with beer industry experts and knowledgeable beer enthusiasts as resources for 
information. 

The Brewers Association's beer style guidelines reflect, as much as possible, historical 
significance, authenticity, or a high profile in the current commercial beer market. Often, the 
historical significance is not clear, or a new beer type in a current market may represent only a 
passing fad and is quickly forgotten. For these reasons, the addition of a style or the 
modification of an existing one is not undertaken lightly and is the product of research, 
consultation, and consideration of market actualities, and may take place over several years. 

Another factor considered is that current commercial examples do not always fit well into 
the historical record, and instead represent a modern version of the style. Our decision to 
include a particular historical beer style takes into consideration the style's brewing traditions 
and the need to preserve those traditions in today's market. The more a beer style has 
withstood the test of time, marketplace, and consumer acceptance, the more likely it is to be 
included in the Brewers Association's style guidelines. 

The availability of commercial examples plays a large role in whether a beer style "makes the 
list." It is important to consider that not every historical or commercial beer style can be 
included, nor is every commercial beer representative of the historical tradition (i.e., a 
brewery labeling a brand as a particular style does not always indicate a fair representation of 
that style). 

Please note that almost all of the classic and traditional beer style guidelines have been 
cross-referenced with data from commercially available beers representative of the style. The 
primary reference for this purpose has been Professor Anton Piendl's comprehensive work 
published in the German Brauindustrie magazine through the years 1982 to 1994, from the 
series "Biere Aus Aller Welt." 

Each style description is purposefully written independently of any reference to another beer 
style to the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, as much as it is possible, beer character is 
not described in terms of ingredients or process. These guidelines attempt to emphasize final 
evaluation of the product and try not to proscribe the formulation or process by which it was 
brewed, except in special circumstances whereby processing clearly defines a style or sensory 
outcomes. Suggestions for adding or updating a beer style guideline may be submitted by 
following the links on this page: <a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/#tab-submitsuggestions">https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/#tab-submitsuggestions</a> . 

The bitterness specifications (IBUs) given in these guidelines are based on standard 
measurements for bitterness derived from kettle isomerization of naturally occurring alpha 
acids. Since reduced isomerized hop extracts may produce substantially different perceived 
bitterness levels when measured by this technique, brewers who use such extracts should 
enter competitions based upon the perceived bitterness present in the finished product. It is 
important to note that perceived bitterness by the beer drinker will not always align with 
expectations created by IBU specifications. 

Notes on Beer Style Guidelines: It is very difficult to consistently align analytical data with 
perceived flavor outcomes. It is also very difficult to consistently align written beer 
descriptions with analytical data and perceived flavor outcomes. 

1. Intensity Level Terminology: Beer flavor attributes referenced in the beer style 
guidelines are often referenced in terms of relative intensity. These attributes can 
include bitterness, flavor, aroma, body, malt, sweetness, and hundreds of individual 
flavor attributes. In order of increasing intensity, the descriptions used include: 

<ul><li>None</li><li>Very low</li><li>Low</li><li>Medium-low</li><li>Medium</li><li>Medium-high</li><li>High</li><li>Very high</li><li>Intense</li></ul> 

2. Color Ranges: The American SRM (Standard Reference Method) and EBC (European 

Brewing Convention) of measuring beer color measure the intensity of a certain 
wavelength of light. These numerical values do not always coincide with our visual 
perception of color lightness and darkness or hue. When in doubt the description of 
color has priority. In order from lightest descriptor to darkest descriptor: 

<b>Color Description: </b> <b>SRM </b><br />
Very light: 1-1.5<br />
Straw: 2-3
<br />Pale: 4
<br />Gold: 5-6
<br />Light amber: 7
<br />Amber : 8
<br />Medium amber : 9
<br />Copper/garnet : 10-12
<br />Light brown : 13-15
<br />Brown/Reddish brown/chestnut brown : 16-17
<br />Dark brown : 18-24
<br />Very dark : 25-39
<br />Black : 40+


3. Bitterness: In the beer world bitterness is analytically measured as “bittering units” or 
“international bitterness units.” The numerical value is a measure of a specific hop 
compound and will not consistently coincide with an individual’s perception of 
bitterness intensity. 
a. Due to genetics and other differences, individuals will have varying sensitivity to 
bitterness. Some will sense high intensity bitterness, while others perceive no 
bitterness in the same beer. The descriptions of bitterness in these guidelines are 
inclined towards representing average sensitivity to bitterness. 
b. Other beer ingredients can contribute perception of bitterness to beer. 
c. The intensity and quality of hop flavor and aroma derived from oils, pellets, whole 
hops, or other hop formats can greatly alter the perception of bitterness intensity. 




Notes on Beer Competitions: Brewers Association Beer Style Guidelines form the basis for 
the guidelines at the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and World Beer Cup (WBC). 

1. Competition Categories: GABF and WBC categories may contain one or more beer 
styles. Categories with multiple beer styles will be organized into subcategories of 
similar style beers. Often this provides the category with sufficient entries to make 
the category competitive or meet minimum entry numbers. 

2. Beer Style Guidelines: Categories at competition may differ somewhat from this 
guideline document. They may include special notes which pertain to that 
competition. These notes might solicit special information from brewers to be 
provided to judges so they may evaluate beer entries more accurately or provide 
clarity to entering brewers regarding possibly confusing or overlapping aspects of 
beer style categories. 

3. Pouring: Beers entered and presented for evaluation in competitions should be 
poured and presented as intended by the brewer. Most beers are intended to be 
poured quietly; some beers are intended to be roused in order to present the beer 
with yeast that may be present in the bottle. If practical, competition organizers 
should allow brewers the opportunity to provide explicit pouring instructions and 
present beers to judges in the manner requested by the brewer.

Heavy Ale exhibited peat smoke character, the 
current marketplace offers many examples with peat 
smoke character present at low to medium-low 
levels. Peat smoke attributes may be absent or 
present at low to medium-low levels. Versions 
exhibiting higher levels of smoke character are 
categorized as Smoke Beer.

should be present 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Medium to high, 
expressed as floral, herbal, earthy, stone fruit or 
other attributes from high hopping rates. 

Perceived bitterness: Medium to high 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters are 
medium to high. Traditional interpretations are 
characterized by medium to medium-high alcohol 
content. The use of water with high mineral content 
results in a crisp, dry beer with a subtle and balanced 
character of sulfur compounds. Diacetyl can be 
absent or may be present at very low levels. 

Body: Medium 

Additional notes: A wide range of hop varieties may 
be used for bitterness or for approximating 
traditional English hop character. The use of water 
with high mineral content may result in a crisp, dry 
beer rather than a malt-accentuated version. 
Original Gravity (°Plato) 1.046-1.064 (11.4-15.7 
°Plato) • Apparent Extract/Final Gravity (°Plato) 
1.012-1.018 (3.1-4.6 °Plato) • Alcohol by Weight

balanced with malt flavors. 

Fermentation Characteristics: Rich, often sweet and 
complex fruity ester attributes can contribute to the 
profile of Strong Ales. Alcohol types can be varied 
and complex. Diacetyl is usually absent in these 
beers but may be present at very low levels. 

Body: Medium to full 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, competition 
organizers may choose to split this category into 
subcategories which reflect strong and very strong 
versions. 
Original Gravity (°Plato) 1.060-1.125 (14.7-29 °Plato) 
• Apparent Extract/Final Gravity (°Plato) 1.014-
1.040 (3.6-10 °Plato) • Alcohol by Weight (Volume) 
5.5%-8.9% (7.0%-11.3%) • Hop Bitterness (IBU) 30-
65 • Color SRM (EBC) 8-21 (16-42 EBC) 

Old Ale 

Color: Copper-red to very dark 

Clarity: Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Fruity esters can 
enhance and complement the malt aroma and flavor 
profile. Old Ales have malt and sometimes caramel 
sweetness. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to medium 

Perceived bitterness: Present but minimal 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters can 
contribute to the character of these beers. Alcohol 
types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality 
of Old Ales is that they undergo an aging process, 
often for years. Aging can occur on their yeast either 
in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle. 
This contributes to a rich, wine-like, and often sweet, 
oxidized character. Complex estery attributes may 
also emerge. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers 
but may be present at very low levels. 

Body: Medium to full 

Additional notes: Low level attributes typical of 
wood aging such as vanilla are acceptable. 
Brettanomyces and acidity reflect historical 
character; low level attributes such as horsey, goaty, 
leathery, phenolic, etc. and acidity may be present 
and balanced with other flavors. Residual flavors that 
come from liquids previously aged in a barrel, such as 
bourbon or sherry, should not be present. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, competition 
organizers may choose to split this category into 
subcategories which reflect strong and very strong 
versions, or historic and modern versions.

Scotch Ale or Wee Heavy 

Color: Light reddish-brown to very dark 

Clarity: Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Scotch Ales are 
aggressively malty with a rich and dominant sweet 
malt aroma and flavor. A caramel character is often 
part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors may be 
present at low levels. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to very 
low 

Perceived bitterness: Not present to very low 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters, if 
present, are generally at low levels. Diacetyl is 
usually absent in these beers but may be present at 
low levels. 

Body: Full 

Additional notes: Pleasant, low level oxidation is 
acceptable in Scotch Ales. Examples exhibiting more 
prevalent oxidation are categorized as Aged Beer. 

While there are conflicting theories as to whether 
traditional Scotch Ales exhibited peat smoke 
character, the current marketplace offers many 
examples with peat smoke character present at low 
to medium levels. Peat smoke attributes may be 
absent or present at low to medium levels. Versions 
exhibiting higher levels of smoke character are 
categorized as Smoke Beer. When using these 
guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at 
competitions, competition organizers may create 
subcategories which reflect groups of entries based 
on presence or absence of peat smoke-derived 
attributes.

Additional notes: Grist may include oats, wheat, or 
other adjuncts to promote haziness. Lactose may be 
used to enhance body and balance. Lactose should 
not lend to, or overwhelm, the flavor character of 
these beers. The term "juicy" is frequently used to 
describe flavor and aroma attributes often present in 
these beers which result from late, often very large,

American-Style Sour Ale 

Color: Pale to black 

Clarity: Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze is 
acceptable at any temperature. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low. In darker 
versions, roasted malt, caramel and chocolate 
aromas and flavors should be present at low levels. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: None to high 

Perceived bitterness: None to high 

Fermentation Characteristics: Moderate to intense, 
yet balanced, fruity esters are present. Diacetyl, DMS 
and Brettanomyces should not be present. The 
evolution of natural acidity at medium-low to high 
levels develops a balanced complexity and is 
expressed as a refreshing, pleasant sourness, in 
harmony with other attributes. The acidity present is 
usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic 
acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the 
mash or in kettle or post wort fermentation and is 
produced by various microorganisms including 
certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a 
complex balance of several types of acid and 
attributes of age. There should be no residual flavors 
from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as 
bourbon or sherry. Wood vessels may be used during 
the fermentation and aging process, but wood-
derived flavors such as vanillin should not be 
present. 

Body: Low to high 

Additional notes: Beers exhibiting wood-derived 
characters or characters of liquids previously aged in 
wood are categorized as Wood-Aged Sour Beer. 
Fruited versions are categorized elsewhere. 

Competition organizers may create subcategories 
which reflect groups of entries based on color, hop 
varieties, microflora, spices, or other ingredients, etc. 
When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about

Additional notes: Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle 
to intense, should be present. Fruit or fruit extracts, 
used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary 
or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit 
character ranging from subtle to intense. Beers 
exhibiting wood-derived attributes or evidence of 
liquids previously aged in wood are categorized as 
Fruited Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Fruited versions of 
Berliner-Style Weisse are categorized elsewhere.

GERMAN ORIGIN ALE STYLES 

German-Style Koelsch 

Color: Straw to gold 

Clarity: Chill haze should not be present 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Malt character is 
very low to low with soft sweetness. Caramel 
character should not be present. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low, and if present, 
should express noble hop character. 

Perceived bitterness: Medium to medium-high 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters are 
absent to low, expressed as pear, apple, or wine-like 
attributes when present. Diacetyl should not be 
present. 

Body: Low to medium-low. Dry and crisp. 

Additional notes: Traditional examples often display 
persistent head retention. Small amounts of wheat 
can be used in brewing beers of this style. Koelsch-
style beers are fermented at warmer temperatures 
than is typical for lagers, but at lower temperatures 
than most English and Belgian-style ales. They are 
aged cold. Ale yeast is used for fermentation. Lager 
yeast is sometimes used for bottle conditioning or 
final cold conditioning.

contributes to medium-low to medium malt aroma 
and flavor. Toast aroma typical of Munich malts 
should be present. Slight nuttiness is acceptable. 
Roast malt character should be present at low levels 
and well-integrated with the overall malt profile. 
Smoke character should not be present. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to medium with 
hop flavor more perceptible than aroma, with 
attributes typical of traditional German noble hops. 

Perceived bitterness: Medium to high, producing a 
clean dry finish. Forty-plus IBU is typical for Altbiers 
originating in Dusseldorf. 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters are 
absent to low, with attributes expressed subtly as 
citrus, pear, dark cherry or plum. A slight sulfur 
aroma is acceptable. Diacetyl should not be present. 

Body: Medium-low to medium. 

Additional notes: The Altbier style is originally from 
the Dusseldorf area. The overall impression is clean, 
crisp and flavorful with a dry finish.

haze 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Malt sweetness is 
absent 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present 

Perceived bitterness: Not present to very low 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters are low 
to medium. Diacetyl should not be present. 
Brettanomyces character may be absent or present 
at low to medium levels, and if present may be 
expressed as horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity 
and/or acidic aromas and flavors. The unique 
combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria 
fermentation yields a beer that is acidic and highly 
attenuated. 

Body: Very low 

Additional notes: Carbonation is high. Traditionally, 
some Berliners were brewed or served with fruit, 
spices, or syrups. Some more contemporary versions 
have been brewed with other ingredients such as 
darker malts. Any such versions will take on 
corresponding hues, and may exhibit flavor and 
aroma attributes typical of such ingredients. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Competition organizers 
may create subcategories which reflect groups of 
entries based on the addition of fruit, spice or 
specialty malt, or other ingredients or processes. 
Fruited or flavored entries would be accompanied by 
a very brief description of the fruit/flavor used by the 
brewer.

malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some 
versions also containing oats. Salt (table salt) and 
coriander may be present in low amounts or may be 
absent. All Gose brands brewed with fruit(s), spices 
(other than salt or coriander), darker malts or other 
ingredients are categorized as Contemporary-Style 
Gose. Carbonation is high to very high. Effervescent. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might

from yeast 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Malt aroma and 
flavor is not present to very low 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to low 

Perceived bitterness: Not present to medium 

Fermentation Characteristics: Horsey, leathery, or 
earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts 
may be present but at low levels as these beers do 
not undergo prolonged aging. Contemporary Gose 
may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or 
with yeast mixed with bacteria. Alternatively, they 
may be spontaneously fermented. Low to medium 
lactic acid character is present in all examples 
expressed as a sharp, refreshing sourness. 

Body: Low to medium-low 

Additional notes: These beers may be brewed with 
malted barley, wheat and oats and unmalted barley, 
wheat, and oats; contemporary examples may also 
contain other grains. As in traditional examples, low 
level salt (table salt) and coriander additions may or 
may not be present in Contemporary Gose. 
Attributes from the use of a wide variety of herbs, 
spices, flowers, fruits or other ingredients not found 
in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose may also be present 
and in harmony with overall flavor profile. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be

levels. Diacetyl should not be present. 

Body: Medium to full 

Additional notes: These beers are made with at least 
50 percent malted wheat. Hefeweizens are very 
highly carbonated. These beers are typically (though 
not always) roused during pouring, and when yeast is 
present, they will have a yeasty flavor and a 
characteristically fuller mouthfeel.

beer is filtered, no yeast should be present. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Malt sweetness is 
very low to medium-low 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to very 
low 

Perceived bitterness: Very low 

Fermentation Characteristics: The aroma and flavor 
are very similar to Hefeweizen with the caveat that 
fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with 
the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of 
yeast. The phenolic characteristics are often 
described as clove-like or nutmeg-like and can be 
smoky or even vanilla-like. A Banana-like ester aroma 
and flavor is often present. Diacetyl should not be 
present. Kristal Weizens are well attenuated and very 
highly carbonated. 

Body: Medium to full 

Additional notes: These beers are made with at least 
50 percent malted wheat. They have no yeast flavor 
and they exhibit a cleaner, drier mouthfeel than 
counterparts served with yeast.

Clarity: If served with yeast, appearance may be very 
cloudy. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to 
medium-low 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to very 
low 

Perceived bitterness: Very low 

Fermentation Characteristics: The phenolic and 
estery aromas typical of Weissbiers should be 
present but less pronounced in this style. The overall 
flavor profile is less complex than Hefeweizen due to 
a lower alcohol content and there is less yeasty 
flavor. Diacetyl should not be present. 

Body: Low with a lighter mouthfeel than Hefeweizen. 
The German word “leicht” means light, and as such 
these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen. 

Additional notes: These beers are made with at least 
50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during 
pouring, and when yeast is present, they will have a 
yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel.

cloudy. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Distinct sweet 
maltiness and caramel or bread-like character arises 
from the use of medium-colored malts. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present 

Perceived bitterness: Low 

Fermentation Characteristics: The phenolic and 
estery aromas and flavors typical of Weissbiers are 
present but less pronounced in Bernsteinfarbenes 
Weissbiers. These beers should be well attenuated 
and very highly carbonated. Diacetyl should not be 
present. 

Body: Medium to full 

Additional notes: These beers are made with at least 
50 percent wheat malt. They are often roused during 
pouring, and when yeast is present, they will have a 
yeasty flavor and a fuller mouthfeel.

Additional notes: Beers in this category recognize 
the uniqueness and traditions of Belgian brewing, 
but do not hew to any other classic or "Other" 
Belgian-style categories defined in these guidelines. 
The most notable characteristic that these beers 
share is a modest alcohol content of 2.1% - 5% abv. 
These beers can be lower gravity formulations of 
their own, or can be produced from second run wort 
from the production of higher gravity beers. Balance 
is a key component when assessing these beers. 
Wood- and barrel-aged versions which exhibit 
attributes of wood aging should be categorized as 
wood- and barrel-aged beers. Fruited versions are 
categorized as Belgian-style fruit beers. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include an underlying Belgian beer style not 
otherwise defined in these guidelines or other 
information unique to the entry such as ingredients 
or processing which influence perceived sensory 
outcomes.

parameters shown in this guideline. Ingredients 
including spices, herbs, flowers, fruits, vegetables, 
fermentable sugars and carbohydrates, special yeasts 
of all types, wood aging, etc. may contribute unique 
attributes to these beers. Earthy and/or cellar-like 
aromas are acceptable. Color, body, malt character, 
esters, alcohol level and hop character should 
harmonize with attributes from special ingredients. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as ingredients such as malts and grains, 
hop varieties, microflora, fruit, spices, or other 
ingredients, etc. or processing which influence 
perceived sensory outcomes.

can be misleading because the red spectrum of color 
is not accurately assessed by these measurement 
systems. 

Clarity: Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. 
Some versions may be more highly carbonated. 
Bottle conditioned versions may appear cloudy when 
served. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Roasted malt 
aromas and flavors including cocoa are acceptable at 
low levels. A very low level of malt sweetness may be 
present and balanced by acidity from Lactobacillus. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present 

Perceived bitterness: Very low to medium-low, 
though acidity and wood aging (if used) may mask 
higher bitterness levels. 

Fermentation Characteristics: Brettanomyces-
produced aromas and flavors should be absent or 
very low. Fruity esters expressed as cherry or green 
apple attributes are apparent. Overall flavor of Oud 
Bruin is fundamentally characterized by low to high 
lactic sourness. Many versions express very low to 
medium acetic sourness and aroma; acetic sourness 
may also be absent. 

Body: Low to medium-low with a refreshing 
mouthfeel 

Additional notes: Oaky or woody flavors may be 
pleasantly integrated. Flavors of wine or distilled 
spirits associated with used barrels should not be

Color: Gold to medium amber 

Clarity: Cloudiness is acceptable 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Sweet malt 
character should not be present 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to very 
low, and can include cheesy or floral lavender-like 
attributes. Hop character is achieved by using stale 
and aged hops at low rates. 

Perceived bitterness: Very low 

Fermentation Characteristics: Characteristic horsey, 
goaty, leathery and phenolic aromas and flavors 
derived from Brettanomyces yeast are often present 
at moderate levels. High to very high fruity esters are 
present. Traditionally, Lambics are unblended and 
spontaneously fermented. They express high to very 
high levels of fruity esters as well as bacteria and 
yeast-derived sourness. Some versions are 
fermented with the addition of cultured yeast and 
bacteria. Carbonation can range from very low to 
high. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should 
not be present. 

Body: Very low with dry mouthfeel 

Additional notes: Lambics originating in the Brussels 
area of Belgium are often simply called Lambic. 
Versions of this beer style made outside of the 
Brussels area cannot be called true Lambics. These 
versions are said to be "Belgian-Style Lambic" and 
may be made to resemble many of the beers of true 
origin. Historically, traditional Lambic is dry and 
completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual 
sweetness either from malt, sugar, or other 
sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through 
the addition of sugars or other sweeteners. 
Traditionally, Lambics are brewed with unmalted 
wheat and malted barley.

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to very 
low and can include cheesy, floral or lavender-like 
attributes. 

Perceived bitterness: Very low 

Fermentation Characteristics: Gueuze represents 
blends of aged and newly fermenting young Lambics. 
These unflavored blended and secondary fermented 
beers may be very dry or mildly sweet. They are 
characterized by intense fruity ester, sour, and acidic 
attributes which only result from spontaneous 
fermentation. Diacetyl should not be present. 
Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic 
aromas and flavors derived from Brettanomyces 
yeast are often present at moderate levels. Vanillin 
and other wood-derived flavors should not be 
present. Carbonation can be none (flat) to medium. 

Body: Very low with dry mouthfeel 

Additional notes: Gueuze originating in the Brussels 
area of Belgium, are often simply called Gueuze. 
Versions of this beer style made outside of the 
Brussels area are said to be "Belgian-Style Gueuze." 
The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble 
many of the beers of true origin. Historically, 
traditional Gueuze is dry and completely attenuated, 
exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, 
sugar, or other sweeteners. Traditionally, Gueuze is 
brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and 
stale, aged hops.

Additional notes: While taking its inspiration from 
the Traditional Gueuze whose origin is the Brussels 
area of Belgium, Contemporary Belgian-Style Spontaneous Fermented Ales may incorporate 
specialty malts, spices or other flavors or fruited 
combinations that influence the hue, flavor, and 
aroma of the finished beer such that they differ 
significantly from traditional examples. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as non-traditional malts, sweeteners used, 
other ingredients or processing which influence 
perceived sensory outcomes.

at moderate levels. Fermented sourness is an 
important part of the flavor profile, though 
sweetness may compromise the intensity. Fruit 
sourness may also be an important part of the 
profile. These flavored Lambic beers may be very dry 
or mildly sweet. Vanillin and other woody flavors 
should not be present. 

Body: Dry to full 

Additional notes: These beers, also known by the 
names Framboise, Kriek, Peche, Cassis, etc., are 
characterized by fruit aromas and flavors. Fruit 
Lambics, whose origin is the Brussels area of 
Belgium, are often simply called Fruit Lambic. 
Versions of this beer style made outside of the 
Brussels area are said to be "Belgian-Style Fruit 
Lambics." The Belgian-style versions are made to 
resemble many of the beers of true origin. 
Historically, traditional Lambics are dry and 
completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual 
sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit, or other 
sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of 
sweetness contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars, 
or other sweeteners. See also Belgian-Style Lambic 
for additional background information. Such beers 
exhibiting wood-derived attributes should be 
categorized in other Wood-Aged categories. 

Competition organizers may create subcategories

Session Beer 

Color: The color should mimic the classic style upon 
which the beer is based 

Clarity: Appearance may vary from brilliant to hazy 
to cloudy and should mimic the classic style upon 
which the beer is based 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Malt attributes 
should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is 
based, but at lower overall intensity due to lower 
original gravity. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Hop attributes 
should mimic the classic style upon which the beer is 
based, but at lower overall intensity in order to 
maintain the balance typical of that style. 

Perceived bitterness: Should mimic the classic style 
upon which the beer is based, but at lower overall 
intensity in order to maintain the balance typical of 
that style. 

Fermentation Characteristics: Varies with underlying 
style 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: This category includes beers of any 
style that 1) are at or below 5.0% abv (4.0% abw), 
and 2) have an original gravity and alcohol content 
below the range of the classic style as defined in 
these guidelines. These beers exhibit lower original 
gravity and alcohol content than the classic style. 
Drinkability is key to a successful session beer. Beers 
at or below 5.0% abv (4% abw) that adhere to the 
specifications of a classic style are not categorized as 
Session Beers. For example, low gravity beers such as 
Belgian-Style Table Beers, Belgian-Style Session Ales 
or English-Style Mild Ales should be categorized 
within their appropriate categories. Drinkability is 
key to a successful session beer. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may 
wish to further subcategorize this category. 
Competition organizers may request that brewers 
provide actual percent alcohol by volume (abv) for 
their entries in this category.

Additional notes: This American-born regional style 
proliferated around Louisville, Kentucky, from the 
Civil War era until Prohibition. Corn grits or flakes 
were commonly used at a rate or 25-35% of the total 
grist. Minerally attributes resulted from the use of 
hard brewing water. These beers were consumed 
very young, going from brewhouse to consumer in as 
little as one week. Early 20th century brewing 
literature mentions a slight tartness developing 
during fermentation as a characteristic attribute of 
this style. If tartness is present in modern versions, it 
should be at very low levels.

Additional notes: These beers can be fermented 
with either ale or lager yeast. The grist should 
include at least 30 percent malted wheat. Versions 
served with yeast may exhibit somewhat higher 
perceived bitterness and fuller mouthfeel. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, organizers may 
wish to further subcategorize this category based on 
the presence or absence of yeast, use of darker malts, 
etc.

Kellerbier or Zwickelbier 

Color: Varies depending on the underlying European 
origin lager or ale style 

Clarity: Typically slightly hazy to moderately cloudy, 
but may become clear through settling. A small 
amount of yeast haze is acceptable and traditional. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies depending 
on the underlying style 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies depending on 
underlying style. Low level attributes typical of late 
or dry hopping may be present in some versions. 

Perceived bitterness: Varies depending on 
underlying style 

Fermentation Characteristics: Low levels of sulfur 
and acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally 
scrubbed during fermentation, if present, can 
enhance the flavor of these beers. Low fruity esters 
may be present and may vary slightly from the 
underlying style due to age and the presence of 
yeast. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers but 
may be present at low levels in keller versions of 
beer styles which can contain diacetyl when fully 
aged, such as Bohemian-Style Lager. 

Body: Varies depending on underlying style 

Additional notes: Kellerbier or Zwickelbiers are 
unfiltered versions of lager or ale styles of European 
origin. These can include traditional Helles, Dunkel, 
Dortmunder, Vienna, Rotbier, Bohemian, Koelsch, 
Alt, as well as less common traditional or 
contemporary European-origin lager and ale styles. 
Kellerbiers have carbonation ranging from low to 
normal and may exhibit poor head retention. These 
beers are typically unfiltered, but they may be 
filtered and then redosed with yeast. Whether 
filtered or unfiltered these beers are packaged and 
served with very low to moderate amounts of yeast. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information should 
include the underlying European-origin lager or ale 
style upon which the entry is based. Competition 
organizers may create subcategories which reflect 
groups of entries based on ale or lager yeast type or 
hue.

American-Style Fruit Beer 

Color: Can range from pale to very dark depending 
on the underlying style and is often influenced by the 
color of added fruit 

Clarity: Clear or hazy is acceptable 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to 
medium-low 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not present to 
medium-low 

Perceived bitterness: In balance with fruit character 
and usually at very low to medium levels 

Fermentation Characteristics: American-Style Fruit 
Beers are fermented with traditional German, British 
or American ale or lager yeast. Beers fermented with 
Belgian-style, German-style Hefeweizen or other 
South German wheat beer or Berliner-style Weisse 
yeasts should be categorized elsewhere. Fruit beers 
exhibiting sourness should be categorized elsewhere. 
Attributes typical of wild fermentation should not be 
present. 

Body: Varies with style 

Additional notes: Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle 
to intense, should be present and should not be 
overpowered by hop aromas. Fruit or fruit extracts, 
used as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary 
or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit 
character ranging from subtle to intense. Within the 
framework of these guidelines, fruit beers fermented 
with Belgian yeast (Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, Saison 
and/or Brettanomyces) should be categorized as 
Belgian-Style Fruit Beers, or possibly as fruited Brett 
Beers. Some beers may fit into this category if they 
contain fruity adjuncts but no actual fruit. As an 
example, a juniper berry-flavored beer with notable 
juniper berry fruity flavor and/or aroma could be 
categorized as a Fruit Beer, whereas a beer in which 
the juniper berry character is more herbal or spicy 
should be categorized as an Herb and Spice Beer. 
Fruit Beers brewed with wheat should be categorized 
as Fruit Wheat Beers. Fruit Beers brewed with 
unusual fermentable(s), but no wheat, should be 
categorized as Fruit Beers. All of the various India 
Pale Ale or Imperial India Pale Ale styles brewed as 
Fruit Beers are categorized as Experimental India 
Pale Ales. All fruited Sour Beers are categorized 
elsewhere. All fruited Wood- and Barrel-Aged beers 
whether sour or not are categorized elsewhere. 
Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is 
defined as a vegetable, and beers containing coconut 
should be categorized as Field Beers. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as fruit(s) used or processing which 
influence perceived sensory outcomes.

Fruit Wheat Beer 

Color: Generally straw to light amber, and often 
influenced by the color of added fruit. 

Clarity: Chill haze is acceptable. These beers may be 
served with or without yeast. When served with 
yeast, appearance is hazy to very cloudy. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to medium-low 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to medium 

Perceived bitterness: Low to medium 

Fermentation Characteristics: These beers can be 
fermented with either ale or lager yeast depending 
on the underlying wheat beer style. Low fruity esters 
are typical. Diacetyl should not be present. In 
versions served with yeast, yeasty aroma and flavor 
should be low to medium. 

Body: Low to medium 

Additional notes: The grist should include at least 30 
percent malted wheat. Fruit or fruit extracts 
contribute aroma and flavor expressing true fruit 
complexity. Versions served with yeast should 
demonstrate a full yeasty mouthfeel. Fruited 
examples of wheat beer styles that are not 
commonly brewed with fruit and do not exhibit 
attributes of wood aging should be categorized as 
Fruit Wheat Beers. These could include fruited 
versions of various wheat beer styles of European 
origin such as Weizens, Adambier or Grodziskie. 
Fruited wheat beers that exhibit sourness fall within 
various fruited sour beer categories. Such beers 
could deviate from parameters shown for those 
styles but should be suggestive of the underlying 
classic beer style with fruit added. Fruited versions of 
Berliner Weisse or Contemporary Gose fall within 
those categories as they are commonly brewed with 
fruit. Within the framework of these guidelines, 
coconut is defined as a vegetable, and beers 
containing coconut should be entered as Field Beers. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for

Belgian-Style Fruit Beer 

Color: Can range from pale to dark depending on 
underlying Belgian style, and is often influenced by 
the color of added fruit 

Clarity: Clear to hazy beer is acceptable 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Can vary from not 
perceived to medium-high 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to high 

Perceived bitterness: Varies with underlying Belgian 
style 

Fermentation Characteristics: Acidic bacterial 
fermentation attributes may be absent or may be 
present; if present, such attributes contribute to 
acidity and enhance fruity balance. 

Body: Varies with style 

Additional notes: Fruit aromas, ranging from subtle 
to intense, should be present and should not be 
overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit 
Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian yeast, 
(Wit, Abbey, Farmhouse, etc.). Within the framework 
of these guidelines, coconut is defined as a 
vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be 
categorized as Field Beers. Fruit or fruit extracts, 
used as adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, primary 
or secondary fermentation, provide harmonious fruit 
character ranging from subtle to intense. Classifying 
these beers can be complex. Wood vessels may be 
used for fermentation and aging, but wood-derived 
aromas and flavors such as vanillin should not be 
present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived from 
wood or liquids previously aged in wood should be 
categorized in other Wood-Aged Beer categories. 
Fruited Belgian-style beers which exhibit 
Brettanomyces may be categorized in this style when 
no other category exists for such beers. However, a 
fruited Saison exhibiting Brett character should be 
categorized as a Specialty Saison. A fruited version of 
a Brett Beer is categorized as Fruited Brett Beer 
when such a Brett-containing beer is not based on an 
existing underlying Belgian beer style. A Lambic-Style 
fruit beer should be categorized as a Belgian-Style 
Fruit Lambic. Fruited Belgian-Style beers brewed with 
additional adjuncts could fall in this category or 
perhaps as Experimental Beers. Fruit beers 
fermented with German, British or American ale or 
lager yeast should be categorized as American-Style 
Fruit Beers or as Fruit Wheat Beers. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be

character. 

Fermentation Characteristics: Varies with underlying 
style 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: Vegetable aromas, ranging from 
subtle to intense, should be present, and should not 
be overpowered by hop aromas. Field Beers are any 
beers incorporating vegetables as flavor or 
carbohydrate adjuncts in either the mash, kettle, 
primary or secondary fermentation. The vegetable 
character should be in harmony with other attributes 
and can range from subtle to intense. Within the 
framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as 
a vegetable, and beers containing coconut should be 
entered as Field Beers. All beers containing chili 
peppers should be categorized as Chili Beers. Beers 
containing nuts should be categorized as Field Beers.

Additional notes: These are any beers using 
pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo) or winter squash as an 
adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or 
secondary fermentation. Pumpkin or squash may not 
be present or may range from subtle to intense. They 
are spiced with other ingredients whose character 
should be present and in balance. While cinnamon, 
allspice, clove, and nutmeg are common spices 
added to American-type pumpkin beers, other spices 
may be used. For example, a brewer could replicate a 
Wit-Pumpkin spiced beer by using orange peel and 
coriander. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate

Additional notes: Chocolate Beers are beers of any 
classic style which incorporate dark chocolate or 
cocoa in any form. Beers made with white chocolate 
do not typify this category; however, beers which 
clearly exhibit attributes typical of white chocolate 
could be categorized as chocolate beer. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, competition 
organizers may create categories which reflect 
groups of chocolate beers based on underlying beer 
style or other factors. Brewers may be asked to 
provide supplemental information about entries in

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, competition 
organizers may create categories which reflect 
groups of coffee beers based on underlying beer style 
or other factors. Brewers may be asked to provide 
supplemental information about entries in this 
category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse 
entries. Such information might include the 
underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, 
or other information unique to the entry such as type 
or form of coffee used or other factors which 
influence perceived sensory outcomes.

Chili Pepper Beer 

Color: Can range from pale to very dark depending 
on the underlying style 

Clarity: Clear or hazy is acceptable 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Can vary from very 
low to medium-high depending on the underlying 
style 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to very 
high 

Perceived bitterness: Very low to medium-high 

Fermentation Characteristics: Chili pepper aroma 
and flavor attributes should be harmonious with the 
underlying beer style. Chili pepper character may be 
expressed as vegetal, spicy and/or hot on the palate. 

Body: Representative of underlying style 

Additional notes: Chili Beers are any beers using chili 
peppers for flavor, aroma and/or heat. Chili 
character can range from subtle to intense. Chili 
pepper aroma may or may not be present. Within 
the framework of these guidelines, all beers 
containing chili peppers should be categorized as 
Chili Beers. Beers made with chili peppers which 
represent more than one style, such as chili beers 
with chocolate, should be nonetheless be 
categorized as Chili Beers rather than as 
Experimental Beers. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as chili(s) used or processing which 
influence perceived sensory outcomes.

Herb and Spice Beer 

Color: Varies depending on underlying style 

Clarity: Clear to hazy is acceptable 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies depending 
on intention of brewer 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Not essential but 
may be present and may be more assertive than 
herb-spice character 

Perceived bitterness: Very low to medium-low. 
Reduced hop bitterness tends to accentuate 
herb/spice character. 

Fermentation Characteristics: Aromas and flavors of 
individual spices may not always be identifiable 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: Herb and Spice beers are any beers 
using herbs or spices derived from leaves, roots, 
seeds, fruits, vegetables, flowers, etc. Herb and/or 
spice character can range from subtle to intense. 
Classifying these beers can be complex. Beers which 
exhibit herbal and/or spicy character are considered 
Herb and Spice Beers. Beers brewed with chili 
peppers are categorized as Chili Pepper Beers. Beers 
brewed with pumpkin in which herb and spice 
character dominates should be categorized as 
Pumpkin Spice Beers. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as type or form of herb(s) or spice(s) used 
or other factors which influence perceived sensory 
outcomes.

Specialty Beer 

Color: Very light to black depending on the 
underlying style 

Clarity: Clear to hazy is acceptable 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies depending 
on intention of brewer 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to very 
high 

Perceived bitterness: Very low to very high 

Fermentation Characteristics: Specialty Beers are 
brewed with atypical fermentable sugars, grains 
and/or starches which contribute to alcohol content. 
The hallmark of Specialty Beers are the distinctive 
attributes of these special ingredients, which should 
be present in the aroma, flavor and overall balance 
of the beer. Examples could include maple syrup, 
agave, potatoes, wild rice, or any other sources of 
carbohydrate not commonly used in modern beer 
styles. Beers containing wheat are categorized in 
one of several wheat beer styles. The use of rice or 
corn would not normally be considered unusual 
since these adjuncts are commonly used in beer 
production. However, beers made with rice or corn 
varieties which imbue highly distinctive flavor 
attributes might be categorized as Specialty Beers. 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: Classifying these beers can be 
complex. Beers made with unusual fermentables, 
which also contain spices, fruits, or other ingredients 
and which therefore represent a combination of two 
or more hybrid beer styles are categorized as 
Experimental Beers. Within the framework of these 
guidelines, nuts generally impart much more flavor 
than fermentables, and beers containing nuts are 
categorized as Field Beers. Likewise, within the 
framework of these guidelines, coconut is defined as 
a vegetable and beers containing coconut are 
categorized as Field Beers. Beers brewed with honey 
are categorized as Specialty Honey Beers. Beers 
brewed with roots, seeds, flowers etc. which exhibit 
herbal and/or spicy characters are categorized as 
Herb and Spice Beers. While beers brewed with fruits 
or vegetables may derive fermentable carbohydrate 
from those sources, they are most appropriately 
categorized within various Fruit Beer or Field Beer 
categories. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as type or form of unusual carbohydrate 
source used or other factors which influence 
perceived sensory outcomes.

Fermentation Characteristics: Honey Beers may be 
brewed to a traditional style or may be experimental. 
Honey Beers incorporate honey as a fermentable 
sugar in addition to malted barley. Honey character 
should be present in aroma and flavor but should not 
be overpowering.

Rye Beer 

Color: A wide range of color is acceptable. Lighter 
versions are straw to copper, while darker versions 
are dark amber to dark brown. 

Clarity: Chill haze is acceptable in versions packaged 
and served without yeast. In versions served with 
yeast, appearance may range from hazy to very 
cloudy. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: In darker versions, 
malt aromas and flavors can optionally include low 
roasted malt character expressed as cocoa/chocolate 
or caramel. Aromatic toffee, caramel, or biscuit 
character may also be present. Low level roastiness, 
graininess, or tannin astringency is acceptable when 
balanced with low to medium malt sweetness. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to medium-high 

Perceived bitterness: Low to medium 

Fermentation Characteristics: Low levels of spicy and 
fruity ester aromas are typical. Yeast-derived aroma 
and flavor attributes such as clove-like or other 
phenolics may be present when consistent with 
underlying beer style. These beers can be fermented 
with either ale or lager yeast. Diacetyl should not be 
present. Low to medium yeast aroma may be present 
in versions packaged with yeast. 

Body: Low to medium. Rye can impart textural 
qualities ranging from dry and crisp to smooth and 
velvety. 

Additional notes: The grist should include sufficient 
rye so that rye character is evident in the beer. Rye 
character is often described as spicy and/or black 
pepper-like and/or earthy. Beers brewed with rye 
that do not exhibit rye character should be 
categorized in other beer styles. Versions served with 
yeast should possess a full yeasty mouthfeel. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for

influenced by the color of added fruits or other 
ingredients. 

Clarity: Chill haze and/or haze from yeast is 
allowable at low to medium levels at any 
temperature 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: In darker versions, 
roasted malt, caramel and chocolate aromas and 
flavors are present at low levels. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Low to high 

Perceived bitterness: Low to high 

Fermentation Characteristics: Medium to high fruity 
esters are present. Acidity resulting from 
Brettanomyces fermentation results in a complex 
flavor profile. Brettanomyces character, at low to 
high levels, should be present and expressed as 
horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic 
aromas and flavors. Brettanomyces character may or 
may not be dominant. Acidity from Brettanomyces 
should be low to medium-low. Cultured yeast strains 
may be used in the fermentation. Beers fermented 
with Brettanomyces that do not exhibit attributes 
typical of Brettanomyces fermentation are 
categorized elsewhere. Beers in this style should not 
incorporate bacteria or exhibit a bacteria-derived 
flavor profile. Diacetyl and DMS should not be 
present. 

Body: Low to high 

Additional notes: Fruited versions will exhibit fruit 
flavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels 
may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood- 
derived flavors and aromas such as vanillin should 
not be present. Residual flavors and aromas 
originating from liquids previously aged in a barrel 
(bourbon, sherry, etc.) should not be present. 
Versions exhibiting attributes derived from wood or 
liquids previously aged in wood are categorized in 
Wood-Aged Beer categories. Sour wood- and barrel-
aged versions are categorized in Wood-Aged Sour 
Beer categories. Entries exhibiting additional sensory 
attributes characteristic arising from microbes other 
than Brett are categorized as Mixed Culture Brett 
Beer. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about

esters are present. Acidity resulting from 
fermentation with Brettanomyces and/or bacteria 
results in a complex flavor profile. Brettanomyces 
character should be present and expressed as 
horsey, goaty, leathery, phenolic, fruity and/or acidic 
aromas and flavors. Cultured yeast may be used in 
the fermentation. Bacteria should be incorporated 
and in evidence. Bacteria will contribute acidity 
which may or may not dominate the flavor profile. 
Diacetyl and DMS should not be present. 

Body: Low to high 

Additional notes: Fruited versions will exhibit fruit 
flavors in balance with other elements. Wood vessels 
may be used for fermentation and aging, but wood-
derived aromas and flavors such as vanillin should 
not be present. Versions exhibiting attributes derived 
from wood or liquids previously aged in wood are 
categorized in Wood-Aged Beer categories. Sour 
wood- and barrel-aged versions are categorized in 
Wood-Aged Sour Beer categories.

Fermentation Characteristics: These beers are 
brewed with sake yeast or sake (koji) enzymes. The 
unique byproducts of sake yeast and/or koji enzymes 
should be distinctive and in harmony with other 
elements. Sake character may best be described as 
having mild fruitiness and mild earthiness, with 
mushroom and/or an umami protein-like character. 
A high amount of alcohol may be evident. 

Body: Varies depending on original gravity.

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Fresh hop aroma 
and flavor is prominent exhibiting green grass-like, 
fresh mown hay/grass or other fresh hop attributes. 

Perceived bitterness: Varies with underlying style 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters may 
present at levels consistent with the underlying beer 
style being made with fresh hops 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: These ales or lagers are brewed 
with freshly harvested hops. Such hops might be 
undried fresh or frozen cones or ground material, or, 
freshly kilned dried cones or pellets. These beers are 
typically consumed while fresh to highlight bright 
fresh hop attributes. Aging these beers will typically 
modify and reduce fresh-hop characters resulting in 
unique flavor outcomes. 

Competition organizers may create subcategories for 
ales and lagers, or which reflect groups of entries 
based on fresh hops in unprocessed, frozen, or kilned 
form. When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as hop varieties used, unprocessed, frozen, 
or kilned, processing or timing of addition(s) (kettle, 
whirlpool, fermenter, aging tank, etc.), other 
ingredients used or other factors which influence 
perceived sensory outcomes.

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: These are any traditional or 
experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in 
either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. 
These beers are aged with the intention of 
developing unique attributes imparted by the wood 
and/or liquids that had previously been stored in 
contact with the wood. Wood aging does not 
necessarily impart wood flavors, but does result in 
distinctive sensory outcomes. Used sherry, rum, 
whiskey, tequila, port, wine, and other barrels are 
often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to 
a beer. A balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel 
results from the marriage of new beer with 
attributes imparted by the wood or barrel. Wood-
Aged Beers may or may not have Brettanomyces 
character. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: These are any traditional or 
experimental style of lager, ale or hybrid beer aged in 
either a wooden barrel or in contact with wood, and 
exhibiting acidity derived from exposure to bacteria. 
These beers are aged in the presence of microflora 
(either present in the wood or introduced at some 
time in the brewing process) with the intention of 
introducing sourness to the beer. These beers are 
aged with the intention of developing unique 
attributes imparted by the wood and/or by liquids 
that had previously been stored in contact with the 
wood. Wood aging does not necessarily impart wood 
flavors but does result in distinctive sensory 
outcomes. Used sherry, rum, whiskey, tequila, port, 
wine and other barrels are often used, imparting 
complexity and uniqueness to a beer. A balance of 
aroma, flavor and mouthfeel results from the 
marriage of new beer with attributes imparted by 
the wood or barrel, and with sourness and/or other 
attributes derived from bacteria. These beers may or 
may not have Brettanomyces character. For purposes 
of competition, entries made with fruit are 
categorized as Fruited Wood-Aged Sour Beer. Entries 
made with spices are categorized as Herb/Spice 
Beers. Entries made with combinations of and or 
fruit(s) and or spices and or other ingredients, and 
which therefore represent combinations of multiple 
hybrid beer styles, are categorized as Experimental 
Beer. 

Versions made with fruit(s) will exhibit attributes of 
wood-aging, acidity and those added fruit(s). 
Competition organizers may choose to create 
subcategories for Wood-aged sour beers made with 
fruit or other ingredients. When using these 
guidelines as the basis for evaluating entries at 
competitions, brewers may be asked to provide 
supplemental information about entries in this 
category to allow for accurate evaluation of diverse 
entries. Such information might include the 
underlying beer style upon which the entry is based, 
or other information unique to the entry such as 
length of time aged, type of wood or barrel, age, char 
level or previous liquids held by the wood, micro flora 
present if known, other ingredients or other 
processing which influence perceived sensory 
outcomes.

Perceived bitterness: Varies with underlying style 

Fermentation Characteristics: Aged Beers are any 
beers aged for over one year. A brewer may brew 
any type of beer of any strength and enhance its 
character with various aging conditions for an 
extended time. In general, beers with high hopping 
rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and/or 
complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best 
candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in 
bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels. 
Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel, 
aroma and flavor. Often, aged character is the result 
of oxidative reactions that either bring individual 
flavor components into harmony or are unique 
flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors 
often develop during aging, and hop character often 
changes. No matter what the effect, the overall 
character should be balanced and without aggressive 
flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary 
with the duration of aging and the underlying beer 
style. Mildly-flavored beers are more likely to 
develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation. 
Positive transformations are more likely to occur in 
beers with higher levels of hops, malt and/or alcohol. 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: Within the framework of these 
guidelines, various Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers 
which then undergo aging of one or more years in 
glass or stainless, and, which clearly exhibit sensory 
outcomes of that additional aging, may be 
categorized as Aged Beers. However, Brett Beers, 
Sour Beers or any other beers exhibiting attributes of 
aging in the presence of any microflora must be 
categorized elsewhere. Beers which have undergone 
aging but which nonetheless do not display 
characteristics of aging are categorized within their 
base styles. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as length of time aged, type of vessel, 
duration of aging process, other ingredients or other 
processing which influence perceived sensory 
outcomes.

Fermentation Characteristics: Will vary widely 
depending on the nature of the techniques and/or 
ingredients used to create the beer 

Body: May vary widely with ingredients used and 
brewing process 

Additional notes: Experimental beers are beers that 
1. employ unique and unusual techniques and/or 
ingredients; or 2. beers that do not meet the criteria 
of individual existing categories, representing a 
combination of two or more hybrid, specialty or 
classic categories (with the exception of beers 
brewed with chili peppers). Experimental beers are 
primarily grain-based with a minimum of 51% of 
fermentable carbohydrates derived from malted 
grains. Beers produced using non-experimental 
techniques and/or ingredients are considered 
experimental beers if their properties overlap two or 
more existing categories and exhibit the distinctive 
characteristics of each of those categories. 
Uniqueness is the primary consideration when 
evaluating this category. Within the framework of 
these guidelines, field, fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, 
specialty, wood-aged or other beers that fit within 
another individual category should not be 
categorized as experimental beers. Within the 
framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed with 
chili peppers are categorized as chili beers, and 
should not be categorized as experimental beers. 
When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include an underlying beer style(s) upon which the 
entry is based (if such style(s) is apparent), or other 
information unique to the entry such as ingredients 
or processing which influence perceived sensory 
outcomes. Competition organizers may create 
subcategories which reflect groups of entries based 
on color, hop varieties, microflora, fruit, spices or 
other ingredients, wood aging, etc.

Experimental India Pale Ale 

Color: Straw to very dark, varying widely with 
ingredients used 

Clarity: May range from clear to very high degree of 
cloudiness. Starch, yeast, hop, protein and/or other 
compounds can contribute to a wide range of hazy 
appearance within this category 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to 
medium-low malt aroma and flavor may be present, 
and may exhibit attributes typical of various adjuncts 
and specialty malts 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Medium to very high 
hop aroma and flavor are present, with attributes 
typical of hops from any origin 

Perceived bitterness: Low to very high 

Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters are low 
to high and may contribute to an overall highly fruity 
impression regardless of the presence or absence of 
fruit(s) used and can contribute to the perception of 
sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile. 
Yeast choices can vary widely as can sensory 
outcomes; very low to low phenolic or other 
attributes typical of wine, champagne or 
Brettanomyces yeast strains may be present but are 
not required. Carbonation can range from average to 
high, with higher levels often associated with a crisp 
mouthfeel. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present. 

Body: Very low to medium, depending on grist and 
yeast choice, enzymatic treatment, finishing 
adjunct(s) and other fermentation parameters. 
Mouthfeel can vary widely from light to full and from 
dry to silky. 

Additional notes: Beers in this category recognize 
the cutting edge of American IPA brewing. 
Experimental India Pale Ales are either 1) any of 
White, Red, Brown, Brut or many other IPA or 
Imperial IPA types or combinations thereof currently 
in production, and fruited or spiced versions of 
these, or 2) fruited, spiced, wood- and barrel-aged or 
other elaborated versions of classic American and 
Juicy Hazy IPA, and Imperial IPA categories. They 
range widely in color, hop and malt intensity and 
attributes, hop bitterness, balance, alcohol content, 
body and overall flavor experience. Black versions of 
India Pale Ale that do not meet the specifications for 
American-Style Black Ale may be considered 
Experimental India Pale Ale. Fruited and spiced 
versions exhibit attributes typical of those 
ingredients, in harmony with hop impression and 
overall flavor experience. Lactose may be used to 
enhance body and balance, but should not lend to, or 
overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers. 
Classifying these beers can be complex. Within the 
framework of these guidelines, nuts generally impart 
much more flavor than fermentables, and beers 
containing nuts are categorized as Field Beers. 
Likewise, within the framework of these guidelines, 
coconut is defined as a vegetable, so beers 
containing coconut are categorized as Field Beers. 
Beers brewed with honey are categorized as 
Specialty Honey Beers. Spiced or fruited versions of 
these beers made with unusual fermentables are 
categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. Within 
the framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed 
with chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beers, and 
should not be categorized as Experimental India Pale 
Ale. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as ingredients or processing which 
influence perceived sensory outcomes.

Additional notes: Beers in this category include 
established historical beers and/or brewing 
traditions from any era or part of the world that do 
not fit within another beer style defined within these 
guidelines. Some Historical beers that could fit 
categories such as Experimental, Herb &amp; Spice, Field 
Beer, etc. may be categorized as historical beers. This 
category pays tribute to beers that incorporate 
unique brewing ingredients and/or techniques that 
were used in the past. Within the framework of 
these guidelines, examples of Historical Beers include 
South American Chicha, Nepalese Chong/Chang, 
African sorghum-based beers and many others. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style(s) upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as ingredients or processing which 
influence perceived sensory outcomes. Competition 
organizers may create subcategories which reflect 
historic beer styles. Evaluations are based on 
technical skill and overall balance, and factors such 
as uniqueness, heritage, regional distinction as well 
as background information about the beer and how 
well it represents the spirit of the category.

Wild Beer 

Color: Any color is acceptable. Versions made with 
fruits or other flavorings may take on corresponding 
hues. 

Clarity: Clear or hazy due to yeast, chill haze or hop 
haze. 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Generally, these 
beers are highly attenuated resulting in very low to 
low malt character. Maltier versions should display 
good overall balance with other flavor components. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Very low to high 

Perceived bitterness: Very low to low 

Fermentation Characteristics: Aromas may vary 
significantly due to fermentation attributes 
contributed by various known and unknown 
microorganisms. The overall balance should be 
complex and balanced. Wild beers are spontaneously 
fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has 
introduced from the ambient air/environment near 
the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild Beers 
may not be fermented with any cultured strains of 
yeast or bacteria. Wild Beers may or may not be 
perceived as acidic. They may include a highly-
variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived 
from the wild microorganisms with which they are 
fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, 
appearance and body are important factors in 
assessing these beers. 

Body: Very low to medium 

Additional notes: Spontaneously fermented beers 
with fruit, spice or other ingredients should be 
categorized as Wild Beers. Within the framework of 
these guidelines, beers which hew to classic or 
traditional categories such as Belgian-Style Lambic, 
Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be categorized as 
such, rather than as Wild Beers. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style(s) upon which the 
entry is based, or other information unique to the 
entry such as ingredients or processing which 
influence perceived sensory outcomes. Competition 
organizers may create subcategories which reflect 
groups of entries based on color, microflora, fruit, 
spices or other ingredients, wood aging, etc.

underlying beer style 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies with 
underlying beer style 

Perceived bitterness: Varies with underlying beer 
style 

Fermentation Characteristics: For Smoke Beers 
based on lager styles, any phenolic notes (if present) 
should be derived from smoke; in such lagers yeast-
derived phenolics should not be present. 

Body: Varies with underlying beer style 

Additional notes: Any style of beer can be smoked. 
The goal is to reach a balance between the style's 
character and the smoky properties. Any smoke beer 
that does not fit other smoke beer categories are 
appropriately categorized here. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style(s), or other 
information unique to the entry such as type of wood 
smoke or processing which influence perceived 
sensory outcomes.

Fermentation Characteristics: Within the framework 
of these guidelines, beers of any style intentionally 
brewed to a higher alcohol content than defined 
within that style’s guidelines are categorized as 
Other Strong Beer. These beers should achieve a 
balance between the style's characteristics and the 
additional alcohol, and are not wood- or barrel-aged. 
All Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers that meet the 
criteria for alcohol content shown below are 
categorized as any of several Wood- and Barrel-Aged 
Beers.

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include the underlying beer style(s) being made to 
higher alcoholic strength, or other information 
unique to the entry such as ingredients or processing 
which influence perceived sensory outcomes such as 
microflora, fruit, spices, or other ingredients, etc.

Gluten-Free Beer 

Color: Varies with underlying style 

Clarity: Varies with underlying style 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies with 
underlying style. Grains and fermentables which 
differ from those typically used to produce a given 
beer style can and will produce flavor and aroma 
outcomes that differ from traditional versions. Such 
differences are to be expected and are acceptable. 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies with 
underlying style 

Perceived bitterness: Varies with underlying style 

Fermentation Characteristics: Although brewers may 
design and identify these beers according to defined 
style guidelines, these beers should be evaluated on 
their own merits without strict adherence to defined 
style parameters. 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: This category includes lagers, ales 
or other beers made from fermentable sugars, grains 
and converted carbohydrates and must also include 
some portion of cereal. All ingredients must be free 
of gluten. Within the framework of these 
guidelines, beers brewed with barley, wheat, spelt, 
rye, and other gluten-containing ingredients may 
not be categorized as Gluten-Free. Gluten-Free 
Beers may contain malted grains that are gluten-free. 
NOTE: These guidelines do not supersede any 
government regulations. Wine, mead, flavored malt 
beverages or beverages other than "beer" as defined 
by the TTB (U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau) are not 
considered “gluten-free beer” under these 
guidelines. Gluten-reduced beers’ original 
ingredients would have gluten content that has 
been reduced by enzymes or other processes to 
reduced levels. Gluten-reduced beers should be 
categorized in the classic style category most 
appropriate for the beer, rather than as Gluten-Free 
Beer. 

When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might 
include an underlying beer style if appropriate, gluten 
free grains and/or other carbohydrate sources or 
other information unique to the entry such as 
ingredients or processing which influence perceived 
sensory outcomes such as microflora, fruit, spices or 
other ingredients, wood aging, etc.

Non-Alcohol Malt Beverage 

Color: Varies with underlying style 

Clarity: Varies with underlying style 

Perceived Malt Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies with 
underlying style 

Perceived Hop Aroma &amp; Flavor: Varies with 
underlying style 

Perceived bitterness: Varies with underlying style 

Fermentation Characteristics: Non-alcohol (N/A) 
malt beverages can emulate the character of any 
beer style defined within these guidelines but 
without alcohol (less than 0.5 percent abv). Due to 
their nature, non-alcohol malt beverages will have a 
profile lacking the complexity and balance of flavors 
that beers containing alcohol will display. N/A beers 
should be assessed with this is mind, and should not 
be given negative evaluations for reasons related to 
the absence of alcohol. 

Body: Varies with underlying style 

Additional notes: For purposes of competition, 
brewers will be asked to verify that the alcohol 
content of entries in this category are &#60;0.5% abv. 
When using these guidelines as the basis for 
evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be 
asked to provide supplemental information about 
entries in this category to allow for accurate 
evaluation of diverse entries, such as the underlying 
classic beer style.
