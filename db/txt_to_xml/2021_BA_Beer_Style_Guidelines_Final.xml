Compiled by the Brewers Association, copyright: 1993 through and including 2021. With 				Style Guideline Committee assistance and review by Chris Swersey, Paul Gatza, Chuck Skypeck,<br>
				Kaylyn Kirkpatrick, Chris Williams, Andrew Sparhawk and Dan Rabin, and suggestions from<br>
				Great American Beer Festival® and World Beer CupSM judges, brewers, beer writers and beer<br>
				lovers from around the world.<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				Since 1979 the Brewers Association has provided beer style descriptions as a reference for<br>
				brewers and beer competition organizers. Much of the early work was based on the assistance<br>
				and contributions of beer journalist Michael Jackson; more recently these guidelines were<br>
				greatly expanded, compiled, and edited by Charlie Papazian. The task of creating a realistic set<br>
				of guidelines is always complex. The beer style guidelines developed by the Brewers<br>
				Association use sources from the commercial brewing industry, beer analyses, and<br>
				consultations with beer industry experts and knowledgeable beer enthusiasts as resources for<br>
				information.<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				The Brewers Association's beer style guidelines reflect, as much as possible, historical<br>
				significance, authenticity, or a high profile in the current commercial beer market. Often, the<br>
				historical significance is not clear, or a new beer type in a current market may represent only a<br>
				passing fad and is quickly forgotten. For these reasons, the addition of a style or the<br>
				modification of an existing one is not undertaken lightly and is the product of research,<br>
				consultation, and consideration of market actualities, and may take place over several years.<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				Another factor considered is that current commercial examples do not always fit well into<br>
				the historical record, and instead represent a modern version of the style. Our decision to<br>
				include a particular historical beer style takes into consideration the style's brewing traditions<br>
				and the need to preserve those traditions in today's market. The more a beer style has<br>
				withstood the test of time, marketplace, and consumer acceptance, the more likely it is to be<br>
				included in the Brewers Association's style guidelines.<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				The availability of commercial examples plays a large role in whether a beer style "makes the<br>
				list." It is important to consider that not every historical or commercial beer style can be<br>
				included, nor is every commercial beer representative of the historical tradition (i.e., a<br>
				brewery labeling a brand as a particular style does not always indicate a fair representation of<br>
				that style).<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				Please note that almost all of the classic and traditional beer style guidelines have been<br>
				cross-referenced with data from commercially available beers representative of the style. The<br>
				primary reference for this purpose has been Professor Anton Piendl's comprehensive work<br>
				published in the German Brauindustrie magazine through the years 1982 to 1994, from the<br>
				series "Biere Aus Aller Welt."<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				Each style description is purposefully written independently of any reference to another beer<br>
				style to the greatest extent possible. Furthermore, as much as it is possible, beer character is<br>
				not described in terms of ingredients or process. These guidelines attempt to emphasize final<br>
				evaluation of the product and try not to proscribe the formulation or process by which it was<br>
				brewed, except in special circumstances whereby processing clearly defines a style or sensory<br>
				outcomes. Suggestions for adding or updating a beer style guideline may be submitted by<br>
				following the links on this page: https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-<br>
				association-beer-style-guidelines/#tab-submitsuggestions.<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				The bitterness specifications (IBUs) given in these guidelines are based on standard<br>
				measurements for bitterness derived from kettle isomerization of naturally occurring alpha<br>
				acids. Since reduced isomerized hop extracts may produce substantially different perceived<br>
				bitterness levels when measured by this technique, brewers who use such extracts should<br>
				enter competitions based upon the perceived bitterness present in the finished product. It is<br>
				important to note that perceived bitterness by the beer drinker will not always align with<br>
				expectations created by IBU specifications.<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				Notes on Beer Style Guidelines: It is very difficult to consistently align analytical data with<br>
				perceived flavor outcomes. It is also very difficult to consistently align written beer<br>
				descriptions with analytical data and perceived flavor outcomes.<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				1. Intensity Level Terminology: Beer flavor attributes referenced in the beer style<br>
				guidelines are often referenced in terms of relative intensity. These attributes can<br>
				include bitterness, flavor, aroma, body, malt, sweetness, and hundreds of individual<br>
				flavor attributes. In order of increasing intensity, the descriptions used include:<br>
<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				● None<br>
				● Very low<br>
				● Low<br>
				● Medium-low<br>
				● Medium<br>
				● Medium-high<br>
				● High<br>
				● Very high<br>
				● Intense<br>
<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				2. Color Ranges: The American SRM (Standard Reference Method) and EBC (European<br>
<br>
				Brewing Convention) of measuring beer color measure the intensity of a certain<br>
				wavelength of light. These numerical values do not always coincide with our visual<br>
				perception of color lightness and darkness or hue. When in doubt the description of<br>
				color has priority. In order from lightest descriptor to darkest descriptor:<br>
<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				Color Description<br>
<br>
				SRM<br>
<br>
				Very light<br>
<br>
				1-1.5<br>
<br>
				Straw<br>
<br>
				2-3<br>
<br>
				Pale<br>
<br>
				4<br>
<br>
				Gold<br>
<br>
				5-6<br>
<br>
				Light amber<br>
<br>
				7<br>
<br>
				Amber<br>
<br>
				8<br>
<br>
				Medium amber<br>
<br>
				9<br>
<br>
				Copper/garnet<br>
<br>
				10-12<br>
<br>
				Light brown<br>
<br>
				13-15<br>
<br>
				Brown/Reddish brown/chestnut brown<br>
<br>
				16-17<br>
<br>
				Dark brown<br>
<br>
				18-24<br>
<br>
				Very dark<br>
<br>
				25-39<br>
<br>
				Black<br>
<br>
				40+
<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				3. Bitterness: In the beer world bitterness is analytically measured as “bittering units” or<br>
				“international bitterness units.” The numerical value is a measure of a specific hop<br>
				compound and will not consistently coincide with an individual’s perception of<br>
				bitterness intensity.<br>
				a. Due to genetics and other differences, individuals will have varying sensitivity to<br>
				bitterness. Some will sense high intensity bitterness, while others perceive no<br>
				bitterness in the same beer. The descriptions of bitterness in these guidelines are<br>
				inclined towards representing average sensitivity to bitterness.<br>
				b. Other beer ingredients can contribute perception of bitterness to beer.<br>
				c. The intensity and quality of hop flavor and aroma derived from oils, pellets, whole<br>
				hops, or other hop formats can greatly alter the perception of bitterness intensity.

<br>
				Notes on Beer Competitions: Brewers Association Beer Style Guidelines form the basis for<br>
				the guidelines at the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and World Beer Cup (WBC).<br>
<br>
				<br>
<br>
				1. Competition Categories: GABF and WBC categories may contain one or more beer<br>
				styles. Categories with multiple beer styles will be organized into subcategories of<br>
				similar style beers. Often this provides the category with sufficient entries to make<br>
				the category competitive or meet minimum entry numbers.<br>
<br>
				2. Beer Style Guidelines: Categories at competition may differ somewhat from this<br>
				guideline document. They may include special notes which pertain to that<br>
				competition. These notes might solicit special information from brewers to be<br>
				provided to judges so they may evaluate beer entries more accurately or provide<br>
				clarity to entering brewers regarding possibly confusing or overlapping aspects of<br>
				beer style categories.<br>
				3. Pouring: Beers entered and presented for evaluation in competitions should be<br>
				poured and presented as intended by the brewer. Most beers are intended to be<br>
				poured quietly; some beers are intended to be roused in order to present the beer<br>
				with yeast that may be present in the bottle. If practical, competition organizers<br>
				should allow brewers the opportunity to provide explicit pouring instructions and<br>
				present beers to judges in the manner requested by the brewer.<br>

				Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor: Very low to medium<br>

				of Old Ales is that they undergo an aging process,<br>
				often for years. Aging can occur on their yeast either<br>
				in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle.<br>
				This contributes to a rich, wine-like, and often sweet,<br>
				oxidized character. Complex estery attributes may<br>
				also emerge. Diacetyl is usually absent in these beers<br>

				The most notable characteristic that these beers<br>
				share is a modest alcohol content of 2.1% - 5% abv.<br>
				These beers can be lower gravity formulations of<br>
				their own, or can be produced from second run wort<br>
				from the production of higher gravity beers. Balance<br>
				is a key component when assessing these beers.<br>
				Wood- and barrel-aged versions which exhibit<br>
				attributes of wood aging should be categorized as<br>
				wood- and barrel-aged beers. Fruited versions are<br>
				categorized as Belgian-style fruit beers.<br>
<br>
				When using these guidelines as the basis for<br>
				evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be<br>
				asked to provide supplemental information about<br>
				entries in this category to allow for accurate<br>
				evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might<br>
				include an underlying Belgian beer style not<br>
				otherwise defined in these guidelines or other<br>
				information unique to the entry such as ingredients<br>

				include the underlying beer style upon which the<br>
				entry is based, or other information unique to the<br>

				Within the framework of these guidelines, coconut is<br>

				categorized as Field Beers. Beers brewed with honey<br>
				are categorized as Specialty Honey Beers. Beers<br>
				brewed with roots, seeds, flowers etc. which exhibit<br>
				herbal and/or spicy characters are categorized as<br>
				Herb and Spice Beers. While beers brewed with fruits<br>

				Fermentation Characteristics: Aged Beers are any<br>
				beers aged for over one year. A brewer may brew<br>
				any type of beer of any strength and enhance its<br>
				character with various aging conditions for an<br>
				extended time. In general, beers with high hopping<br>
				rates, roast malt, high alcohol content, and/or<br>
				complex herbal, smoke or fruit character are the best<br>
				candidates for aging. Aged Beers may be aged in<br>
				bottles, cans, kegs or other non-wooden vessels.<br>
				Aged character may be expressed in mouthfeel,<br>
				aroma and flavor. Often, aged character is the result<br>
				of oxidative reactions that either bring individual<br>
				flavor components into harmony or are unique<br>
				flavors unto themselves. Sherry-like and fruity flavors<br>
				often develop during aging, and hop character often<br>
				changes. No matter what the effect, the overall<br>
				character should be balanced and without aggressive<br>
				flavors. The level of change created by aging will vary<br>
				with the duration of aging and the underlying beer<br>
				style. Mildly-flavored beers are more likely to<br>
				develop aggressive and unpleasant oxidation.<br>
				Positive transformations are more likely to occur in<br>
				beers with higher levels of hops, malt and/or alcohol.<br>
<br>
				<big><b>Body:</b></big> Varies with underlying style <br>

				Additional notes: Within the framework of these<br>
				guidelines, various Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beers<br>
				which then undergo aging of one or more years in<br>
				glass or stainless, and, which clearly exhibit sensory<br>
				outcomes of that additional aging, may be<br>
				categorized as Aged Beers. However, Brett Beers,<br>
				Sour Beers or any other beers exhibiting attributes of<br>
				aging in the presence of any microflora must be<br>
				categorized elsewhere. Beers which have undergone<br>
				aging but which nonetheless do not display<br>
				characteristics of aging are categorized within their<br>
				base styles.<br>

				and may exhibit attributes typical of various adjuncts<br>
				and specialty malts<br>
<br>
				Perceived Hop Aroma & Flavor: Medium to very high<br>
				hop aroma and flavor are present, with attributes<br>
				typical of hops from any origin<br>
<br>
				Perceived bitterness: Low to very high<br>
<br>
				Fermentation Characteristics: Fruity esters are low<br>
				to high and may contribute to an overall highly fruity<br>
				impression regardless of the presence or absence of<br>
				fruit(s) used and can contribute to the perception of<br>
				sweetness and be complementary to the hop profile.<br>
				Yeast choices can vary widely as can sensory<br>
				outcomes; very low to low phenolic or other<br>
				attributes typical of wine, champagne or<br>
				Brettanomyces yeast strains may be present but are<br>
				not required. Carbonation can range from average to<br>
				high, with higher levels often associated with a crisp<br>
				mouthfeel. Diacetyl and DMS should not be present.<br>
<br>
				<big><b>Body:</b></big> Very low to medium, depending on grist and <br>
				yeast choice, enzymatic treatment, finishing<br>
				adjunct(s) and other fermentation parameters.<br>
				Mouthfeel can vary widely from light to full and from<br>
				dry to silky.<br>
<br>
				Additional notes: Beers in this category recognize<br>
				the cutting edge of American IPA brewing.<br>
				Experimental India Pale Ales are either 1) any of<br>
				White, Red, Brown, Brut or many other IPA or<br>
				Imperial IPA types or combinations thereof currently<br>
				in production, and fruited or spiced versions of<br>
				these, or 2) fruited, spiced, wood- and barrel-aged or<br>
				other elaborated versions of classic American and<br>
				Juicy Hazy IPA, and Imperial IPA categories. They<br>
				range widely in color, hop and malt intensity and<br>
				attributes, hop bitterness, balance, alcohol content,<br>
				body and overall flavor experience. Black versions of<br>
				India Pale Ale that do not meet the specifications for<br>
				American-Style Black Ale may be considered<br>
				Experimental India Pale Ale. Fruited and spiced<br>
				versions exhibit attributes typical of those<br>
				ingredients, in harmony with hop impression and<br>
				overall flavor experience. Lactose may be used to<br>
				enhance body and balance, but should not lend to, or<br>
				overwhelm, the flavor character of these beers.<br>
				Classifying these beers can be complex. Within the<br>
				framework of these guidelines, nuts generally impart<br>
				much more flavor than fermentables, and beers<br>
				containing nuts are categorized as Field Beers.<br>
				Likewise, within the framework of these guidelines,<br>
				coconut is defined as a vegetable, so beers<br>
				containing coconut are categorized as Field Beers.<br>
				Beers brewed with honey are categorized as<br>
				Specialty Honey Beers. Spiced or fruited versions of<br>
				these beers made with unusual fermentables are<br>
				categorized as Experimental India Pale Ale. Within<br>
				the framework of these guidelines, all beers brewed<br>
				with chili peppers are categorized as Chili Beers, and<br>
				should not be categorized as Experimental India Pale<br>
				Ale.<br>
<br>
				When using these guidelines as the basis for<br>
				evaluating entries at competitions, brewers may be<br>
				asked to provide supplemental information about<br>
				entries in this category to allow for accurate<br>
				evaluation of diverse entries. Such information might<br>
				include the underlying beer style upon which the<br>
				entry is based, or other information unique to the<br>
				entry such as ingredients or processing which<br>
				influence perceived sensory outcomes.<br>

				some portion of cereal. All ingredients must be free<br>
				of gluten. Within the framework of these<br>

				Beers may contain malted grains that are gluten-free.<br>
				NOTE: These guidelines do not supersede any<br>

				beverages or beverages other than "beer" as defined<br>
				by the TTB (U.S. Trade and Tax Bureau) are not<br>
